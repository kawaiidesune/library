Taking ten of the most common objections to Marxism—that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so on—he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid.

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview. This unusual depth has helped make The Tim Ferriss Show the first business/interview podcast to pass 100 million downloads.<br> <br>“This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‘inside baseball’ you won’t find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.<br> <br>“What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?<br> <br>“I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.<br> <br>“Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I’ve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.<br> <br>“I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It’s changed my life, and I hope the same for you.”</p></div><!-- End description for Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers --><span class="asin">1328683788</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium5767380C-2671-451C-9AD8-489D95B21506"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('5767380C-2671-451C-9AD8-489D95B21506');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/5767380C-2671-451C-9AD8-489D95B21506-256.png" width="169" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062226657?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Winning Arguments: What Works and Doesn't Work in Politics, the Bedroom, the Courtroom, and the Classroom</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stanley%20Fish&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stanley Fish  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>“Fish mines cultural touchstones from Milton to ‘Married with Children’ to explain how various types of arguments are structured and how that understanding can lead to victory” — New York Times Book Review<br><br>A lively and accessible guide to understanding rhetoric by the world class English and Law professor and bestselling author of How to Write a Sentence.<br><br>Filled with the wit and observational prowess that shaped Stanley Fish’s acclaimed bestseller How to Write a Sentence, Winning Arguments guides readers through the “greatest hits” of rhetoric.

The stories reflect not only the beliefs of various literary schools, but the preoccupations of French civilization, at the various times of their composition, with the metaphysical and psychological problems of man. Contents include Micromégas (Voltaire), La Messe de l'Athée (Honoré de Balzac), La Légende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier (Gustave Flaubert), Le Spleen de Paris (Charles Baudelaire), Menuet (Guy de Maupassant), Mort de Judas (Paul Claudel), Le Retour de l'Enfant Prodigue (André Gide), Grand-Lebrun (François Mauriac), Le Passe-Muraille (Marcel Aymé), and L'Hôte (Albert Camus). Students of French, or those who wish to refresh their knowledge of the language, will welcome this treasury of masterly fiction. The selections are arranged chronologically, allowing the reader to witness the development of French literary art — from Voltaire to Camus. Excellent English translations appear on pages facing the original French. Also included are a French-English vocabulary list, textual notes, and exercises.</p></div><!-- End description for French Stories / Contes Français --><span class="asin">0486264432</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="livres-3.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="livres-2.html">2</a> <a class="page" href="livres-3.html">3</a> <span class="page">4</span> <a class="page" href="livres-5.html">5</a> <a class="page" href="livres-6.html">6</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="livres-5.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
