The answer is not obvious, despite the fact that we are often stuck dealing with people for whom there is no better name. We try to avoid them, but assholes are everywhere—at work, at home, on the road, in the public sphere—and we struggle to comprehend why exactly someone should be acting like that.<br> <br>Asshole management begins with asshole understanding. Finally giving us the concepts to discern why assholes disturb us so, philosopher Aaron James presents a provocative theory of the asshole to explain why such people exist, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism. We get a better sense of when the asshole is best resisted and best ignored—a better sense of what is, and what is not, worth fighting for.</p></div><!-- End description for Assholes: A Theory --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumF55D80B3-4F32-48EC-8EBD-14162D08F9DF"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1583229299"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/F55D80B3-4F32-48EC-8EBD-14162D08F9DF-256.png" width="168" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1583229299?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Derrick%20Jensen%0AAric%20McBay%0ALierre%20Keith&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Derrick Jensen, Aric McBay, Lierre Keith  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>For years, Derrick Jensen has asked his audiences, "Do you think this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of life?"

Technology can't fix it, and shopping—no matter how green—won’t stop it. To save this planet, we need a serious resistance movement that can bring down the industrial economy. Deep Green Resistance evaluates strategic options for resistance, from nonviolence to guerrilla warfare, and the conditions required for those options to be successful. It provides an exploration of organizational structures, recruitment, security, and target selection for both aboveground and underground action. Deep Green Resistance also discusses a culture of resistance and the crucial support role that it can play.<br>Deep Green Resistance is a plan of action for anyone determined to fight for this planet—and win.</p></div><!-- End description for Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet --></div><div class="medium" id="medium98EAD074-4C26-44F0-ADE8-BCDD93B25E8F"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1450400248"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/98EAD074-4C26-44F0-ADE8-BCDD93B25E8F-256.png" width="177" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1450400248?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Yoga Anatomy-2nd Edition</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Leslie%20Kaminoff%0AAmy%20Matthews&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Leslie Kaminoff, Amy Matthews  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The best-selling anatomy guide for yoga is now updated, expanded, and better than ever!<br><br>With more asanas, vinyasas, full-color anatomical illustrations, and in-depth information, the second edition of Yoga Anatomy provides you with a deeper understanding of the structures and principles underlying each movement and of yoga itself.<br><br>From breathing to inversions to standing poses, see how specific muscles respond to the movements of the joints; how alterations of a pose can enhance or reduce effectiveness; and how the spine, breathing, and body position are all fundamentally linked.<br><br>Whether you are just beginning your journey or have been practicing yoga for years, Yoga Anatomy will be an invaluable resource—one that allows you to see each movement in an entirely new light.<br><br>With Yoga Anatomy, Second Edition, authors Leslie Kaminoff and Amy Matthews, both internationally recognized experts and teachers in anatomy, breathing, and bodywork, have created the ultimate reference for yoga practitioners, instructors, and enthusiasts alike.</p></div><!-- End description for Yoga Anatomy-2nd Edition --></div><div class="medium" id="medium0F6F5230-108E-48AE-9757-BA2098380F90"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1421513684"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/0F6F5230-108E-48AE-9757-BA2098380F90-256.png" width="171" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1421513684?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Pretty Face, Vol. 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Yasuhiro%20Kano&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Yasuhiro Kano  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>He wanted to be her boyfriend...<br><br>He'll settle for being her twin sister!<br><br>When his school bus crashes, teenage karate star Rando is sent into a coma.
