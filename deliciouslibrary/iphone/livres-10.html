These characters also appear in genre pieces, accessible to the mainstream, instead of being hidden away in so-called "worthier" pieces, as in the past. This book discusses issues of race, disability, sexuality, and transgender people with specific reference to characterization in movies, TV, and novel writing. Using such examples as the film Mad Max: Fury Road and the novel Gone Girl, the book explores how character role function really works. It discusses such questions as the difference between stereotype and archetype, why "trope" does not mean what Twitter and Tumblr think it means, how the burden of casting affects both box office and audience perception, and why diversity is not about agendas, buzzwords or being "politically correct." It also goes into what authenticity truly means, and why research is so important; why variety is key in ensuring true diversity in characterization; and what agents, publishers, producers, filmmakers, and commissioners are looking for—and why.</p></div><!-- End description for Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumAC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1588991962"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E-256.png" width="178" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588991962?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Onegai Teacher Book 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Shizuru%20Hayashiya&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Shizuru Hayashiya  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>ONEGAI TEACHER VOL.1<br><br>Kei Kusanagi was your typical ordinary senior in High School.

The way she does with her clients. Some of whom are regular inhabitants of the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists.<br><br>Romancing the Beat is a recipe, not a rigid system. The beats don't care if you plot or outline before you write, or if you pants your way through the drafts and do a "beat check" when you're revising. Pantsers and plotters are both welcome.
