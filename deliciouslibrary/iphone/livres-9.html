So she’ll work the convention circuit. But then a costar is brazenly murdered in front of her. With a killer who vanishes into thin air with seemingly inhuman skill, and strange events plaguing Marnie, she feels she can’t even trust her own senses.<br><br>Although his dear departed parents were famous actors, PI Bryan McFadden is about as far from Hollywood as you can get. The former military man is reluctant to get involved in such a bizarre case, but it quickly becomes obvious that Marnie is in grave danger, and he is compelled to help. It’s unclear if the killer is an obsessed fan or something more sinister. Could the show’s cast be cursed?

However his gory appetite is controlled by Harry’s Code,” which limits his victims to those who have gotten away with murder, and his job as a blood spatter expert for the Miami police department gives him the inside track on just who those legitimate targets may be.<br>In Dexter and Philosophy, an elite team of philosophers don their rubber gloves and put Dexter’s deeds under the microscope. Since Dexter is driven to ritual murder by his Dark Passenger,” can he be blamed for killing, especially as he only murders other murderers? Does Dexter fit the profile of the familiar fictional type of the superhero? What part does luck play in making Dexter who he is? How and why are horror and disgust turned into aesthetic pleasure for the TV viewer? How essential is Dexter’s emotional coldness to his lust for slicing people up? Are Dexter’s lies and deceptions any worse than the lies and deceptions of the non-criminals around him? Why does Dexter long to be a normal human being and why can’t he accomplish this apparently simple goal?</p></div><!-- End description for Dexter and Philosophy: Mind over Spatter --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB101DA2F-E42D-4894-8F6B-B38673FEE22F"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1452147310"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B101DA2F-E42D-4894-8F6B-B38673FEE22F-256.png" width="216" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1452147310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">642 Stories to Write</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=The%20San%20Francisco%20Writers%27%20Grotto&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">The San Francisco Writers' Grotto  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The quirky inspiration of the 642 series takes flight in this collection of fiction-writing prompts that will make anyone want to grab a pen and write what happens next.</p></div><!-- End description for 642 Stories to Write --></div><div class="medium" id="medium090B2562-A89E-4A45-B28A-8695509EB70D"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1506701442"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/090B2562-A89E-4A45-B28A-8695509EB70D-256.png" width="169" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506701442?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Henchgirl</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kristen%20Gudsnuk&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kristen Gudsnuk  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Mary Posa hates her job.

what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.  Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.<br> <br>In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.  Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives.  And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.  This remarkable book will start you on your way.</p></div><!-- End description for The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future --></div><div class="medium" id="medium87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0399536108"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C-256.png" width="188" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399536108?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Chris%20Guillebeau&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Chris Guillebeau  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>If you've ever thought, "There must be more to life than this," The Art of Non-Conformity is for you.<br><br>Based on Chris Guillebeau's popular online manifesto "A Brief Guide to World Domination," The Art of Non-Conformity defies common assumptions about life and work while arming you with the tools to live differently.
