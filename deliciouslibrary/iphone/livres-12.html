Great companies are made, not born. The secret is hiring the right people—the "A" players. This is, of course, easier said than done. Statistically, half of all employment situations result in a mis-hire; the wrong person for the wrong job. And with the cost of a mis-hire at twenty-four times salary, the financial drain can be staggering! Compare that with Brad Smart's 90% success rate and understand why topgraded organizations such as General Electric and Allied Signal consistently beat the competition. In this unparalleled work, Dr. Smart introduces readers to the tograding concept—how and why it works. The author sets forth principles which hold true for Fortune 500 companies as well as small emerging companies. Topgrading is a silver bullet—the corporate initiative that empowers all other corporate initiatives. The author spells out his practical hands-on approach and provides intriguing case studies culled from his file of more than 4,000 in-depth interviews. Topgrading's expert coaching techniques are also revealed and readers learn how managers who topgrade become leaders, achieving success and excellence not only for their companies, but also for themselves. This book is not without controversy, however, as Brad discusses how those who don't pull their own weight, the chronic "C" players, must step aside, be redeployed, or terminated.</p></div><!-- End description for Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching and Keeping the Best People --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumFF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1610693132"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/FF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3-256.png" width="166" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610693132?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=David%20E.%20Newton%20Ph.D.&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">David E.

He brings the requirements and process of renouncing U.S. Citizenship down to earth. He takes the politics, confusion, and fear out of the process. After reading this book you'll know exactly what you need to do, and how to do it. You'll also be amazed at how quick and easy it is. Included are copies of all of the government forms he filed in the process, as well as parts of the U.S. State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual which express the process form the government's viewpoint. Of course, a copy of his "Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN)" is also included, signed, sealed and stamped by U.S government authorities. He cannot help you decide if you should renounce your citizenship or not. He takes you through the process so you can exercise your rights if you decide to. You too, will be able to walk into a U.S. Embassy as an American and leave as a “foreigner”. With one signature, step outside of all the politics and drama associated with the United States. Remember, all rights and privileges and all duties and allegiance you had as an American are gone. You've been born again! Why renounce your U.S. Citizenship? While it seems that a large portion of the world's population wants to move to the United States and become a citizen there, there is a movement of another kind too. As throughout the history of the United States, some American's chose to leave the country and renounce their citizenship. That process based on my personal experiences is straightforward and simple. One aspect of the process that is completely irrelevant is the question: Why? It is not asked, and if answered not relevant to the process. It is simply your right to renounce, and the choice is yours alone to make. As a practical matter, everyone that learns of your decision will ask you why! For me, the short answer is simply that “I outgrew the United States.” The long answer would start with something along the lines of: “For roughly 20 years, basically my entire adult life in the United States I was in conflict. My conflict was with every nature of 'authority', local, state, corporate, prestigious universities as well as at a federal level including the CIA, the FBI, the U.S. Military and even the President of the United States. The conflict was a result of my perspectives on privacy, surveillance, free of information and related topics. Really, it was my expression of my viewpoints on those topics which was the conflict.” Completing the long answer would return me to that era of conflict and bring the fear and anger back to myself, as well as inflict it on you. Life offers much more interesting adventures and I am off to explore them now.</p></div><!-- End description for How to Renounce Your U.S. Citizenship in Two Easy Steps --></div><div class="medium" id="medium07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/B00TZ8ABS4"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8-256.png" width="157" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TZ8ABS4?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Christian Voices in Unitarian Universalism: Contemporary Essays</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kathleen%20Rolenz&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kathleen Rolenz  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Fifteen personal stories from laity and clergy alike show what it means to be a Unitarian Universalist Christian today.These men and women arrive at their faith by many paths—influenced by the Bible, Jesus Christ Superstar and even the Bernstein Mass.
