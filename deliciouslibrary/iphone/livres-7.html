He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br><br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br><br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p></div><!-- End description for Steve Jobs --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumC4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1626924686"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/C4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568-256.png" width="185" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626924686?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Kindred Spirits on the Roof: The Complete Collection</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Hachi%20Ito%0AAya%20Fumio&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Hachi Ito, Aya Fumio  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a yuri manga omnibus based on a bestselling visual novel game of the same title.

Can the two girls go back to their relationship the way it was before, or are they ready for it to evolve into something else?
