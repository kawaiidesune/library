DeSalvo advises her readers to explore their creative process on deeper levels by getting to know themselves and their stories more fully over a longer period of time. She writes in the same supportive manner that encourages her students, using the slow writing process to help them explore the complexities of craft. The Art of Slow Writing is the antidote to self-help books that preach the idea of fast-writing, finishing a novel a year, and quick revisions. DeSalvo makes a case that more mature writing often develops over a longer period of time and offers tips and techniques to train the creative process in this new experience.<br><br>DeSalvo describes the work habits of successful writers (among them, Nobel Prize laureates) so that readers can use the information provided to develop their identity as writers and transform their writing lives. It includes anecdotes from classic American and international writers such as John Steinbeck, Henry Miller, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence as well as contemporary authors such as Michael Chabon, Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides, Ian McEwan, and Salman Rushdie. DeSalvo skillfully and gently guides writers to not only start their work, but immerse themselves fully in the process and create texts they will treasure.</p></div><!-- End description for The Art of Slow Writing: Reflections on Time, Craft, and Creativity --></div><div class="medium" id="medium6A0C18C5-B616-4E7B-A116-09FAD9CED3E1"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0399154469"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6A0C18C5-B616-4E7B-A116-09FAD9CED3E1-256.png" width="165" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399154469?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Fatal Revenant</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stephen%20R.%20Donaldson&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stephen R.

Even though she distrusts the seemingly different man he has now become, how can she make any choice except to follow him?<br><br>Their journey will cover unimaginable distances through the Land-even through time itself-and will test Linden's courage again and again.
