Would-be dancers who have longed to learn the intricacies of this ancient dance form can now experience the pleasure of learning and mastering all the basic steps, putting together an individualized routine and adding magic to their performance with veils, swords, and the tiny finger cymbals known as zills . Each complex movement of the body is painstakingly broken down into concise step-by-step directions that are easy to follow. Perfect for the basic beginner, the instructions also offer alternatives and additions to the movements to accommodate a dancer’s growing skill. The lavish sequence of images captures each delicately curved hip and splayed finger; the arch of a foot and the arc of a backbend; and the careful placement of a leg.

Make sure your next production deployment goes smoothly with this hands-on book, which guides you through the entire production process. You'll set up scripts to install and configure all the software your servers need, including your application code. Once you're in production, you'll learn how to set up systems to monitor your application's health, gather metrics so you can stop problems before they start, and fix things when they go wrong.<br><br>Deploying Rails takes you on a expertly guided tour of the current best practices in Rails deployment and management. You'll find in-depth explanations on effectively running a Rails app by leveraging popular open source tools such as Puppet, Capistrano, and Vagrant. Then you'll go beyond deployment and learn how to use Ganglia and Nagios to monitor your application's health and gather metrics so you can head off problems before they happen.<br><br>You'll start out by building your own virtual environment by writing scripts to provision a production server with Vagrant and Puppet. Then you'll leverage the popular Rails deployment tool Capistrano to deploy an application into this infrastructure. Once the app is live, you'll monitor your application's health with Nagios, and configure Ganglia to collect system metrics. Finally, you'll see how to keep your data backed up, recover data when things go wrong, tame your log files, and use Puppet to automate everything along the way.<br><br>Whether you're a Rails developer who wants a better understanding of the needs of a production Rails system, if you're a system administrator who wants to manage a Rails application, or if you're bridging the gap between development and operations, this book will be your roadmap to successful production deployment and maintenance, whether your application has ten users or ten million users.<br><br>What You Need:<br><br>The exercises and examples are most suited to a computer running some Unix variant, such as Mac OS X or Linux. But a Windows machine running Linux in a VirtualBox virtual machine is also sufficient.<br><br>We'll show you how to set up a local virtual machine for your deployments; you won't need a dedicated server to hone your deployment skills.

The Art of Slow Writing is the antidote to self-help books that preach the idea of fast-writing, finishing a novel a year, and quick revisions. DeSalvo makes a case that more mature writing often develops over a longer period of time and offers tips and techniques to train the creative process in this new experience.<br><br>DeSalvo describes the work habits of successful writers (among them, Nobel Prize laureates) so that readers can use the information provided to develop their identity as writers and transform their writing lives.

Lawrence as well as contemporary authors such as Michael Chabon, Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides, Ian McEwan, and Salman Rushdie.
