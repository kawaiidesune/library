He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br><br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br><br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p></div><!-- End description for Steve Jobs --></div><div class="medium" id="medium6BE422D3-FEFF-465B-840A-6F5DF1107885"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0470316608"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6BE422D3-FEFF-465B-840A-6F5DF1107885-256.png" width="170" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470316608?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">House and Philosophy: Everybody Lies</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Henry%20Jacoby%0AWilliam%20Irwin&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Henry Jacoby, William Irwin  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>An unauthorized look at the philosophical issues raised by one of today's most popular television shows: House House is one of the top three television dramas on the air, pulling in more than 19 million viewers for each episode.

The answer is not obvious, despite the fact that we are often stuck dealing with people for whom there is no better name.

Finally giving us the concepts to discern why assholes disturb us so, philosopher Aaron James presents a provocative theory of the asshole to explain why such people exist, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism.
