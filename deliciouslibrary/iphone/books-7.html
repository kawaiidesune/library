To Stalin, he was such a threat that he warranted murder by pickax. This polarizing figure set up a world conflict that lasted through the twentieth century, and in Trotsky: A Graphic Biography, the renowned comic artist Rick Geary uses his distinct style to depict the stark reality of the man and his times. Trotsky's life becomes a guide to the creation of the Soviet Union, the horrors of World War I, and the establishment of international communism as he, Lenin, and their fellow Bolsheviks rise from persecution and a life underground to the height of political power. Ranging from his boyhood in the Ukraine to his fallout with Stalin and his moonlight romance with Frida Kahlo, Trotsky is a stunning look at one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers and the far-reaching political trends that he launched.</p></div><!-- End description for Trotsky: A Graphic Biography --></div><div class="medium" id="medium788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0931779618"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920-256.png" width="181" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0931779618?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Jefferson Bible for the Twenty-first Century</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Luis%20Granados%0ARoy%20Speckhardt&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Luis Granados, Roy Speckhardt  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Paperback: 194 pages Publisher: Humanist Press; 2 edition (November 7, 2014) Language: English ISBN-10: 0931779618 ISBN-13: 978-0931779619 Product Dimensions: 5 x 0.4 x 8 inches</p></div><!-- End description for A Jefferson Bible for the Twenty-first Century --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumA7A957A7-FA28-4973-95C8-02BDD3547151"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0812697170"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A7A957A7-FA28-4973-95C8-02BDD3547151-256.png" width="170" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812697170?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Dexter and Philosophy: Mind over Spatter</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Richard%20Greene%0AGeorge%20A.%20Reisch%0ARachel%20Robison&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Richard Greene, George A.

However his gory appetite is controlled by Harry’s Code,” which limits his victims to those who have gotten away with murder, and his job as a blood spatter expert for the Miami police department gives him the inside track on just who those legitimate targets may be.<br>In Dexter and Philosophy, an elite team of philosophers don their rubber gloves and put Dexter’s deeds under the microscope. Since Dexter is driven to ritual murder by his Dark Passenger,” can he be blamed for killing, especially as he only murders other murderers? Does Dexter fit the profile of the familiar fictional type of the superhero? What part does luck play in making Dexter who he is? How and why are horror and disgust turned into aesthetic pleasure for the TV viewer? How essential is Dexter’s emotional coldness to his lust for slicing people up? Are Dexter’s lies and deceptions any worse than the lies and deceptions of the non-criminals around him?

what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.  Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.<br> <br>In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.  Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives.  And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.  This remarkable book will start you on your way.</p></div><!-- End description for The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future --></div><div class="medium" id="medium87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0399536108"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C-256.png" width="188" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399536108?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Chris%20Guillebeau&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Chris Guillebeau  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>If you've ever thought, "There must be more to life than this," The Art of Non-Conformity is for you.<br><br>Based on Chris Guillebeau's popular online manifesto "A Brief Guide to World Domination," The Art of Non-Conformity defies common assumptions about life and work while arming you with the tools to live differently.

His whistleblowing has shaken the leaders of nations worldwide, and generated a passionate public debate on the dangers of global monitoring and the threat to individual privacy.<br> <br>In a tour de force of investigative journalism that reads like a spy novel, award-winning Guardian reporter Luke Harding tells Snowden’s astonishing story—from the day he left his glamorous girlfriend in Honolulu carrying a hard drive full of secrets, to the weeks of his secret-spilling in Hong Kong, to his battle for asylum and his exile in Moscow. For the first time, Harding brings together the many sources and strands of the story—touching on everything from concerns about domestic spying to the complicity of the tech sector—while also placing us in the room with Edward Snowden himself. The result is a gripping insider narrative—and a necessary and timely account of what is at stake for all of us in the new digital age.</p></div><!-- End description for The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World&apos;s Most Wanted Man --></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-6.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-5.html">5</a> <a class="page" href="books-6.html">6</a> <span class="page">7</span> <a class="page" href="books-8.html">8</a> <a class="page" href="books-9.html">9</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-8.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
