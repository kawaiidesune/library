You'll set up scripts to install and configure all the software your servers need, including your application code. Once you're in production, you'll learn how to set up systems to monitor your application's health, gather metrics so you can stop problems before they start, and fix things when they go wrong.<br><br>Deploying Rails takes you on a expertly guided tour of the current best practices in Rails deployment and management. You'll find in-depth explanations on effectively running a Rails app by leveraging popular open source tools such as Puppet, Capistrano, and Vagrant.

Then you'll leverage the popular Rails deployment tool Capistrano to deploy an application into this infrastructure. Once the app is live, you'll monitor your application's health with Nagios, and configure Ganglia to collect system metrics. Finally, you'll see how to keep your data backed up, recover data when things go wrong, tame your log files, and use Puppet to automate everything along the way.<br><br>Whether you're a Rails developer who wants a better understanding of the needs of a production Rails system, if you're a system administrator who wants to manage a Rails application, or if you're bridging the gap between development and operations, this book will be your roadmap to successful production deployment and maintenance, whether your application has ten users or ten million users.<br><br>What You Need:<br><br>The exercises and examples are most suited to a computer running some Unix variant, such as Mac OS X or Linux. But a Windows machine running Linux in a VirtualBox virtual machine is also sufficient.<br><br>We'll show you how to set up a local virtual machine for your deployments; you won't need a dedicated server to hone your deployment skills.

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview.

It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.<br> <br>“What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?<br> <br>“I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.<br> <br>“Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion.
