By turns hilarious and deeply moving, Jennifer Finney Boylan explores the territory that lies between men and women, examines changing friendships, and rejoices in the redeeming power of family. Told in Boylan’s fresh voice, She’s Not There is about a person bearing and finally revealing a complex secret. As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and intuitive selves. Now with a new epilogue from the author and an afterword from Deirdre "Grace" Boylan, She’s Not There shines a light on the often confounding process of accepting ourselves.</p></div><!-- End description for She&apos;s Not There: A Life in Two Genders --></div><div class="medium" id="medium477AB395-203C-4203-9596-FE633A106BCB"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0807016179"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/477AB395-203C-4203-9596-FE633A106BCB-256.png" width="188" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807016179?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=John%20Buehrens%0AForrest%20Church&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">John Buehrens, Forrest Church  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>For those contemplating religious choices, Unitarian Universalism offers an appealing alternative to religious denominations that stress theological creeds over individual conviction and belief.

From remotely controlling the overhead paging system of a large supermarket, to confusing the phone company with various call forwarding stunts, this bizarre collection of pranks will not only make you laugh, but will make you question the security and sanity of common, everyday business procedures. Learn how one illustrious member of the PLA crossed the country on stolen credit cards, staying in the nicest hotels one day and then sleeping on the streets of major cities the next, all while amusing himself at the expense of others. Laugh as he turns a radio morning show into his own interactive game, enrages users of an online auction site, uses revenge tactics that cross the line, systematically drives convenience store employees nuts so that he can get a job, and confuses an entire neighborhood of cordless phone users. The stories contained in this book are based on the writings from the Phone Losers of America website which have been featured in USA Today, the Boston Herald, 2600, on CNBC, CNN, TechTV, and countless other websites, books, magazines, radio shows and police reports.</p></div><!-- End description for Phone Losers of America --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/078582944X"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7-256.png" width="184" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/078582944X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Nigel%20Cawthorne&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Nigel Cawthorne  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Despite being incredibly popular during his time, Nikola Tesla today remains largely overlooked among lists of the greatest inventors and scientists of the modern era. Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<br><br>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<br><br>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.</p></div><!-- End description for Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah --></div><div class="medium" id="medium63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0975914723"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C-256.png" width="177" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975914723?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Raymond Chandler  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Book on Michael Jackson All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</p></div><!-- End description for All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up --></div><div class="medium" id="medium1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1595824510"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803-256.png" width="173" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1595824510?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Chobits, Vol. 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Clamp&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Clamp  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Some people buy their personal computers based on style... and in near-future Japan, the hottest style for your "persocom" is shaped like an attractive android!
