Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell draw on their experience from their MyLifeBits project at Microsoft Research to explain the benefits to come from an earth-shaking and inevitable increase in electronic memories. In 1998 they began using Bell, a luminary in the computer world, as a test case, attempting to digitally record as much of his life as possible. Photos, letters, and memorabilia were scanned. Everything he did on his computer was captured. He wore an automatic camera, an arm-strap that logged his bio-metrics, and began recording telephone calls. This experiment, and the system they created to support it, put them at the center of a movement studying the creation and enjoyment of e-memories.<br><br>Since then the three streams of technology feeding the Total Recall revolution—digital recording, digital storage, and digital search, have become gushing torrents. We are capturing so much of our lives now, be it on the date- and location-stamped photos we take with our smart phones or in the continuous records we have of our emails, instant messages, and tweets—not to mention the GPS tracking of our movements many cars and smart phones already do automatically. We are storing what we capture either out there in the “cloud” of services such as Facebook or on our very own increasingly massive and cheap hard drives. But the critical technology, and perhaps least understood, is our magical new ability to find the information we want in the mountain of data that is our past. And not just Google it, but data mine it so that, say, we can chart how much exercise we have been doing in the last four weeks in comparison with what we did four years ago. In health, education, work life, and our personal lives, the Total Recall revolution is going to change everything. As Bell and Gemmell show, it has already begun.<br><br>Total Recall provides a glimpse of the near future. Imagine heart monitors woven into your clothes and tiny wearable audio and visual recorders automatically capturing what you see and hear. Imagine being able to summon up the e-memories of your great grandfather and his avatar giving you advice about whether or not to go to college, accept that job offer, or get married. The range of potential insights is truly awesome. But Bell and Gemmell also show how you can begin to take better advantage of this new technology right now. From how to navigate the serious question of privacy and serious problem of application compatibility to what kind of startups Bell is willing to invest in and which scanner he prefers, this is a book about a turning point in human knowledge as well as an immediate practical guide.<br><br>Total Recall is a technological revolution that will accomplish nothing less than a transformation in the way humans think about the meaning of their lives.<br><br>Watch a Video</p></div><!-- End description for Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumDDD7D3DE-2B0E-4305-AD3F-71FEE25B87D6"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1557000026"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/DDD7D3DE-2B0E-4305-AD3F-71FEE25B87D6-256.png" width="197" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1557000026?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Helena%20Petrovna%20Blavatsky&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Continuously in print for over 100 years, the SD remains today the most comprehensive sourcebook of the esoteric tradition, outlining the fundamental tenets of the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic Ages. Challenging, prophetic, and strikingly modern, it directly addresses the perennial questions: continuity of life after death, purpose of existence, good and evil, consciousness and substance, sexuality, karma, evolution, and human and planetary transformation. Based on the ancient Stanzas of Dzyan with corroborating testimony from over 1,200 sources, these volumes unfold the drama of cosmic and human evolution — from the reawakening of the gods after a Night of the Universe to the ultimate reunion of cosmos with its divine source.

As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and intuitive selves.

From remotely controlling the overhead paging system of a large supermarket, to confusing the phone company with various call forwarding stunts, this bizarre collection of pranks will not only make you laugh, but will make you question the security and sanity of common, everyday business procedures. Learn how one illustrious member of the PLA crossed the country on stolen credit cards, staying in the nicest hotels one day and then sleeping on the streets of major cities the next, all while amusing himself at the expense of others. Laugh as he turns a radio morning show into his own interactive game, enrages users of an online auction site, uses revenge tactics that cross the line, systematically drives convenience store employees nuts so that he can get a job, and confuses an entire neighborhood of cordless phone users. The stories contained in this book are based on the writings from the Phone Losers of America website which have been featured in USA Today, the Boston Herald, 2600, on CNBC, CNN, TechTV, and countless other websites, books, magazines, radio shows and police reports.</p></div><!-- End description for Phone Losers of America --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/078582944X"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7-256.png" width="184" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/078582944X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Nigel%20Cawthorne&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Nigel Cawthorne  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Despite being incredibly popular during his time, Nikola Tesla today remains largely overlooked among lists of the greatest inventors and scientists of the modern era. Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<br><br>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<br><br>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.</p></div><!-- End description for Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah --></div><div class="medium" id="medium63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0975914723"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C-256.png" width="177" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975914723?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Raymond Chandler  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Book on Michael Jackson All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</p></div><!-- End description for All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up --></div><div class="medium" id="medium06BD89EE-2DD8-4DCF-85F1-E4CEB6229A0D"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1623150310"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/06BD89EE-2DD8-4DCF-85F1-E4CEB6229A0D-256.png" width="171" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1623150310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Paleo for Beginners: Essentials to Get Started</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=John%20Chatham&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">John Chatham  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Discover why more people continue to choose Paleo for Beginners—the New York Times bestselling Paleo cookbook that has sold over 150,000 copies sold—more than any other Paleo cookbook.<br><br>Paleo is not just another fad diet; it is the diet humans were designed to eat.
