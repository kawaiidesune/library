But on their first day of high school, they're stunned to learn that the new seating plan has them on opposite sides of the classroom! So, since everyone knows that long distance relationships won't work unless the parties involved put extra effort into it, they decide they need to do something extra special to permanently seal their friendship. However, deciding to kiss each other awakens a whole new level of feelings, and it doesn't help that some of their classmates seem to be 'involved" in similar circumstances. So what's a girl to do when her best girl friend suddenly seems more like a girlfriend? It's a life lesson that the school curriculum isn't normally prepared to teach, except maybe in French class, and our two young heroines are about to get a private education you'll never forget! Discover the truth about the birds and the... er… birds, as two young ladies learn to deal with the pros and cons of intramural osculation in SAKURA TRICK!</p></div><!-- End description for Sakura Trick Complete Collection --></div><div class="medium" id="medium8A1330BD-5670-444B-921F-9B99BAED68B1"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/B0081AWUI6"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/8A1330BD-5670-444B-921F-9B99BAED68B1-256.png" width="182" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0081AWUI6?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Step Up Love Story - Complete Collection</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=dvd&amp;field-director=Hiroshi%20Ishiodori%0AYuji%20Moriyama&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Hiroshi Ishiodori, Yuji Moriyama  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Makoto and Yura are a newly married couple, happy and deeply in love.

Instead, he got turned into a Kämpfer - a lady who's supposed to fight and kill other girls in mortal combat!
