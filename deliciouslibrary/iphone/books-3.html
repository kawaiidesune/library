Like Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, it's a story exhilaratingly suited to graphic memoir form.<br><br>Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned "fun home," as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescense, the denouement is swift, graphic — and redemptive.</p></div><!-- End description for Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic --></div><div class="medium" id="medium98A365E2-CE3F-4BBC-B862-234E43CE2880"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0525951342"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/98A365E2-CE3F-4BBC-B862-234E43CE2880-256.png" width="178" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525951342?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Gordon%20Bell%0AJim%20Gemmell&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Gordon Bell, Jim Gemmell  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>THE TOTAL RECALL REVOLUTION IS INEVITABLE.<br><br>IT WILL CHANGE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.<br><br>IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.<br><br>What if you could remember everything? Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell draw on their experience from their MyLifeBits project at Microsoft Research to explain the benefits to come from an earth-shaking and inevitable increase in electronic memories. In 1998 they began using Bell, a luminary in the computer world, as a test case, attempting to digitally record as much of his life as possible. Photos, letters, and memorabilia were scanned. Everything he did on his computer was captured. He wore an automatic camera, an arm-strap that logged his bio-metrics, and began recording telephone calls. This experiment, and the system they created to support it, put them at the center of a movement studying the creation and enjoyment of e-memories.<br><br>Since then the three streams of technology feeding the Total Recall revolution—digital recording, digital storage, and digital search, have become gushing torrents. We are capturing so much of our lives now, be it on the date- and location-stamped photos we take with our smart phones or in the continuous records we have of our emails, instant messages, and tweets—not to mention the GPS tracking of our movements many cars and smart phones already do automatically. We are storing what we capture either out there in the “cloud” of services such as Facebook or on our very own increasingly massive and cheap hard drives. But the critical technology, and perhaps least understood, is our magical new ability to find the information we want in the mountain of data that is our past. And not just Google it, but data mine it so that, say, we can chart how much exercise we have been doing in the last four weeks in comparison with what we did four years ago. In health, education, work life, and our personal lives, the Total Recall revolution is going to change everything. As Bell and Gemmell show, it has already begun.<br><br>Total Recall provides a glimpse of the near future. Imagine heart monitors woven into your clothes and tiny wearable audio and visual recorders automatically capturing what you see and hear. Imagine being able to summon up the e-memories of your great grandfather and his avatar giving you advice about whether or not to go to college, accept that job offer, or get married. The range of potential insights is truly awesome. But Bell and Gemmell also show how you can begin to take better advantage of this new technology right now. From how to navigate the serious question of privacy and serious problem of application compatibility to what kind of startups Bell is willing to invest in and which scanner he prefers, this is a book about a turning point in human knowledge as well as an immediate practical guide.<br><br>Total Recall is a technological revolution that will accomplish nothing less than a transformation in the way humans think about the meaning of their lives.<br><br>Watch a Video</p></div><!-- End description for Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumDDD7D3DE-2B0E-4305-AD3F-71FEE25B87D6"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1557000026"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/DDD7D3DE-2B0E-4305-AD3F-71FEE25B87D6-256.png" width="197" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1557000026?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Helena%20Petrovna%20Blavatsky&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Helena Petrovna Blavatsky  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Continuously in print for over 100 years, the SD remains today the most comprehensive sourcebook of the esoteric tradition, outlining the fundamental tenets of the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic Ages.

Based on the ancient Stanzas of Dzyan with corroborating testimony from over 1,200 sources, these volumes unfold the drama of cosmic and human evolution — from the reawakening of the gods after a Night of the Universe to the ultimate reunion of cosmos with its divine source.

Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<br><br>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<br><br>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.</p></div><!-- End description for Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah --></div><div class="medium" id="medium63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0975914723"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C-256.png" width="177" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975914723?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Raymond Chandler  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Book on Michael Jackson All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</p></div><!-- End description for All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up --></div><div class="medium" id="medium1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1595824510"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803-256.png" width="173" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1595824510?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Chobits, Vol. 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Clamp&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Clamp  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Some people buy their personal computers based on style... and in near-future Japan, the hottest style for your "persocom" is shaped like an attractive android!
