Surely these things would never happen to you.<br><br>Zoe Quinn used to feel the same way. She is a video game developer whose ex-boyfriend published a crazed blog post cobbled together from private information, half-truths, and outright fictions, along with a rallying cry to the online hordes to go after her. They answered in the form of a so-called movement known as #gamergate—they hacked her accounts; stole nude photos of her; harassed her family, friends, and colleagues; and threatened to rape and murder her. But instead of shrinking into silence as the online mobs wanted her to, she raised her voice and spoke out against this vicious online culture and for making the internet a safer place for everyone.<br><br>In the years since #gamergate, Quinn has helped thousands of people with her advocacy and online-abuse crisis resource Crash Override Network. From locking down victims' personal accounts to working with tech companies and lawmakers to inform policy, she has firsthand knowledge about every angle of online abuse, what powerful institutions are (and aren't) doing about it, and how we can protect our digital spaces and selves.<br><br>Crash Override offers an up-close look inside the controversy, threats, and social and cultural battles that started in the far corners of the internet and have since permeated our online lives. Through her story—as target and as activist—Quinn provides a human look at the ways the internet impacts our lives and culture, along with practical advice for keeping yourself and others safe online.</p></div><!-- End description for Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate --></div><div class="medium" id="mediumA4640940-3EE9-4952-A854-156534C9A467"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0062566733"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/A4640940-3EE9-4952-A854-156534C9A467-256.png" width="158" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062566733?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Hate to Want You: Forbidden Hearts</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Alisha%20Rai&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Alisha Rai  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Alisha Rai, one of contemporary romance’s brightest stars, makes her Avon Books debut with the first novel in the sexy Forbidden Hearts series!<br><br>One night.

He brings the requirements and process of renouncing U.S. Citizenship down to earth. He takes the politics, confusion, and fear out of the process. After reading this book you'll know exactly what you need to do, and how to do it. You'll also be amazed at how quick and easy it is. Included are copies of all of the government forms he filed in the process, as well as parts of the U.S. State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual which express the process form the government's viewpoint. Of course, a copy of his "Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN)" is also included, signed, sealed and stamped by U.S government authorities. He cannot help you decide if you should renounce your citizenship or not. He takes you through the process so you can exercise your rights if you decide to. You too, will be able to walk into a U.S. Embassy as an American and leave as a “foreigner”. With one signature, step outside of all the politics and drama associated with the United States. Remember, all rights and privileges and all duties and allegiance you had as an American are gone. You've been born again! Why renounce your U.S. Citizenship? While it seems that a large portion of the world's population wants to move to the United States and become a citizen there, there is a movement of another kind too. As throughout the history of the United States, some American's chose to leave the country and renounce their citizenship. That process based on my personal experiences is straightforward and simple. One aspect of the process that is completely irrelevant is the question: Why? It is not asked, and if answered not relevant to the process. It is simply your right to renounce, and the choice is yours alone to make. As a practical matter, everyone that learns of your decision will ask you why! For me, the short answer is simply that “I outgrew the United States.” The long answer would start with something along the lines of: “For roughly 20 years, basically my entire adult life in the United States I was in conflict. My conflict was with every nature of 'authority', local, state, corporate, prestigious universities as well as at a federal level including the CIA, the FBI, the U.S. Military and even the President of the United States. The conflict was a result of my perspectives on privacy, surveillance, free of information and related topics. Really, it was my expression of my viewpoints on those topics which was the conflict.” Completing the long answer would return me to that era of conflict and bring the fear and anger back to myself, as well as inflict it on you. Life offers much more interesting adventures and I am off to explore them now.</p></div><!-- End description for How to Renounce Your U.S. Citizenship in Two Easy Steps --></div><div class="medium" id="medium07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/B00TZ8ABS4"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8-256.png" width="157" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TZ8ABS4?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Christian Voices in Unitarian Universalism: Contemporary Essays</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kathleen%20Rolenz&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kathleen Rolenz  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Fifteen personal stories from laity and clergy alike show what it means to be a Unitarian Universalist Christian today.These men and women arrive at their faith by many paths—influenced by the Bible, Jesus Christ Superstar and even the Bernstein Mass.
