Understanding and effectively using point of view allows you to write a powerful narrative that draws readers in and engages them with characters in a meaningful way. Through a blend of practical instruction, useful examples, and helpful exercises, Writing the Intimate Character shows you how to create the experience of living through a character rather than just reading about one.<br>Inside, you'll learn:The functions and benefits of first-person, third-person intimate, omniscient, and second-person points of view.How to apply character cues—specific behaviors, sensory perceptions, dialogue, and visual imagery—to develop a realistic protagonist and secondary cast.The surface and subset feelings that get to the root of your character’s emotions.How different viewpoints affect the story you want to tell.Writing the Intimate Character helps you craft a novel in which readers can experience your characters' senses, dive inside their minds, and truly feel their emotions.<br><br>"Writing the Intimate Character, the latest engaging guide by Jordan Rosenfeld, is a rich resource we'll all be learning from for the rest of our lives. 'Does the term point of view seem too dull and dry?' she asks. 'Try intimacy instead.' And then she shows us how, with diverse examples and wise observation. Now that I have Jordan's take on how to create a character from the inside out, I'm eager to get to it. You, too, will find this book that inspiring." —Rebecca Lawton, author of Sacrament: Homage to a River and other books<br><br>"Writing the Intimate Character provides insights, examples, and exercises that will be useful not only to those who are new to writing fiction but to those, like myself, who are coming back to it after a break. Jordan Rosenfeld's explanation of how narrative voice works with point of view and other literary elements to create characters that readers care deeply about is clear and revelatory. The book can be worked through methodically or dipped into as needed. It's a useful tool for getting the gears of imagination working or for jump-starting and fine-tuning a work in process." —Zoe Zolbrod, author of the novel Currency and the memoir The Telling<br><br>"Jordan Rosenfeld has a keen insight into how to construct characters who are truly lived-in. With intelligence and wit, she walks you through every element of powerful characterization, from selecting your POV to demonstrating character growth throughout your story. Whether you're new to fiction or a more experienced writer, put your trust in Jordan Rosenfeld; she'll help you tell a better story." —Laura Bogart, freelance writer and novelist</p></div><!-- End description for Writing the Intimate Character: Create Unique, Compelling Characters Through Mastery of Point of View --></div><div class="medium" id="medium42C8BBC8-FAF6-4ADD-A358-FA98B32202FA"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1626921644"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/42C8BBC8-FAF6-4ADD-A358-FA98B32202FA-256.png" width="178" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626921644?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Citrus Vol. 3</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Saburouta&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Saburouta  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Yuzuko Aihara, a high school girl whose main interests are fashion, friends and having fun, is about to get a reality check.

It turned out to be a very long speech, lasting over eight and a half hours. And it hit a nerve. Millions followed the speech online until the traffic crashed the Senate server. A huge, positive grassroots response tied up the phones in the senator’s offices in Vermont and Washington. President Obama reportedly held an impromptu press conference with former President Clinton to deflect media attention away from Sander' speech. Editorials and news coverage appeared throughout the world.<br><br>In his speech, Sanders blasted the agreement that President Obama struck with Republicans, which extended the Bush tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, lowered estate tax rates for the very, very rich, and set a terrible precedent by establishing a "payroll tax holiday" diverting revenue away from the Social Security Trust Fund, threatening the fund’s very future. But the speech was more than a critique of a particular piece of legislation. It was a dissection of the collapse of the American middle class and a well-researched attack on corporate greed and on public policy which, over the last several decades, has led to a huge growth in millionaires even as the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. It was a plea for a fundamental change in national priorities, for government policy that reflects the needs of working families, and not just the wealthy and their lobbyists.<br><br>Finally, Sanders' speech-published here in its entirety with a new introduction by the senator-is a call for action. It is a passionate statement informing us that the only people who will save the middle class of this country is the middle class itself, but only if it is informed, organized, and prepared to take on the enormously powerful special interests dominating Washington.</p></div><!-- End description for The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class --></div><div class="medium" id="medium361D88D0-9A87-46A8-88C3-8BDF87954DD9"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1612435009"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/361D88D0-9A87-46A8-88C3-8BDF87954DD9-256.png" width="178" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1612435009?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The 5 A.M.
