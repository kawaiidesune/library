How to think like a director, regardless of equipment (amateurs think about the camera, pros think about communication).  It's about the rules developed over a century of movie-making—which work just as well when shooting a two-year-old's birthday party. Written by Steve Stockman, the director of Two Weeks (2007), plus TV shows, music videos, and hundreds of commercials, How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck explains in 74 short, pithy, insightful chapters how to tell a story and entertain your audience. How to shoot video people will want to watch.<br><br>Here's how to think in shots—how to move-point-shoot-stop-repeat, instead of planting yourself in one spot and pressing "Record" for five minutes. Why never to shoot until you see the whites of your subject's eyes. Why to "zoom" with your feet and not the lens. How to create intrigue on camera. The book covers the basics of framing, lighting, sound (use an external mic), editing, special effects (turn them off!), and gives advice on shooting a variety of specific situations: sporting events, parties and family gatherings, graduations and performances. Plus, how to make instructional and promotional videos, how to make a music video, how to capture stunts, and much more. At the end of every chapter is a suggestion of how to immediately put what you learned into practice, so the next time you're shooting you'll have begun to master the skill. Accompanying the book is a website with video clips to illustrate different rules, techniques, and situations.</p></div><!-- End description for How to Shoot Video That Doesn&apos;t Suck: Advice to Make Any Amateur Look Like a Pro --></div><div class="medium" id="medium2D9E78D1-3D5B-46EB-A6B7-7E1859248CCA"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1452143358"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/2D9E78D1-3D5B-46EB-A6B7-7E1859248CCA-256.png" width="199" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1452143358?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">100 Perfect Hair Days: Step-by-Steps for Pretty Waves, Braids, Curls, Buns, and More!</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jenny%20Strebe&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Jenny Strebe  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Loose waves, chic low ponies, natural curls, elegant updos, classic braids, and more!

Deep in the forest-covered mountains is an all-girls school, attended by children from only the richest and most prestigious of families. Here, the girls are raised to be perfect young ladies, cut off from the real world to preserve their innocence and ensure that they're free from all distractions. This policy of isolation is a double-edged sword, however, for after graduation, students of the academy often struggle to adapt to a world that's totally different from their cloistered school life. To combat this inevitable culture shock, an average teenage boy, Kagurazaka Kimito, is kidnapped by the school to provide its students with knowledge of the outside world. Forced to enroll against his wishes, Kimito must now attend classes in a place where his very manhood relies on keeping the girls happy. Can one regular guy possibly survive in a fearsome, all-female student body.</p></div><!-- End description for Shomin Sample: I Was Abducted by an Elite All-Girls School as a Sample Commoner Vol. 1 --></div><div class="medium" id="medium6E3FD06A-797D-4C58-8A6C-F962C0FDE263"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0316360163"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/6E3FD06A-797D-4C58-8A6C-F962C0FDE263-256.png" width="178" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316360163?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Fruits Basket Collector's Edition, Vol. 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Natsuki%20Takaya&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Natsuki Takaya  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>After a family tragedy turns her life upside down, plucky high schooler Tohru Honda takes matters into her own hands and moves out...into a tent!
