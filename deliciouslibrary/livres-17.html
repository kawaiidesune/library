He brings the requirements and process of renouncing U.S. Citizenship down to earth. He takes the politics, confusion, and fear out of the process. After reading this book you'll know exactly what you need to do, and how to do it. You'll also be amazed at how quick and easy it is. Included are copies of all of the government forms he filed in the process, as well as parts of the U.S. State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual which express the process form the government's viewpoint. Of course, a copy of his "Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN)" is also included, signed, sealed and stamped by U.S government authorities. He cannot help you decide if you should renounce your citizenship or not. He takes you through the process so you can exercise your rights if you decide to. You too, will be able to walk into a U.S. Embassy as an American and leave as a “foreigner”. With one signature, step outside of all the politics and drama associated with the United States. Remember, all rights and privileges and all duties and allegiance you had as an American are gone. You've been born again! Why renounce your U.S. Citizenship? While it seems that a large portion of the world's population wants to move to the United States and become a citizen there, there is a movement of another kind too. As throughout the history of the United States, some American's chose to leave the country and renounce their citizenship. That process based on my personal experiences is straightforward and simple. One aspect of the process that is completely irrelevant is the question: Why? It is not asked, and if answered not relevant to the process. It is simply your right to renounce, and the choice is yours alone to make. As a practical matter, everyone that learns of your decision will ask you why! For me, the short answer is simply that “I outgrew the United States.” The long answer would start with something along the lines of: “For roughly 20 years, basically my entire adult life in the United States I was in conflict. My conflict was with every nature of 'authority', local, state, corporate, prestigious universities as well as at a federal level including the CIA, the FBI, the U.S. Military and even the President of the United States. The conflict was a result of my perspectives on privacy, surveillance, free of information and related topics. Really, it was my expression of my viewpoints on those topics which was the conflict.” Completing the long answer would return me to that era of conflict and bring the fear and anger back to myself, as well as inflict it on you. Life offers much more interesting adventures and I am off to explore them now.</p></div><!-- End description for How to Renounce Your U.S. Citizenship in Two Easy Steps --><span class="asin">999532895X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/07465312-1E54-495C-AA77-A104FD13B2A8-256.png" width="157" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TZ8ABS4?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Christian Voices in Unitarian Universalism: Contemporary Essays</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Kathleen%20Rolenz&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Kathleen Rolenz  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Fifteen personal stories from laity and clergy alike show what it means to be a Unitarian Universalist Christian today.These men and women arrive at their faith by many paths—influenced by the Bible, Jesus Christ Superstar and even the Bernstein Mass.

Understanding and effectively using point of view allows you to write a powerful narrative that draws readers in and engages them with characters in a meaningful way. Through a blend of practical instruction, useful examples, and helpful exercises, Writing the Intimate Character shows you how to create the experience of living through a character rather than just reading about one.<br>Inside, you'll learn:The functions and benefits of first-person, third-person intimate, omniscient, and second-person points of view.How to apply character cues—specific behaviors, sensory perceptions, dialogue, and visual imagery—to develop a realistic protagonist and secondary cast.The surface and subset feelings that get to the root of your character’s emotions.How different viewpoints affect the story you want to tell.Writing the Intimate Character helps you craft a novel in which readers can experience your characters' senses, dive inside their minds, and truly feel their emotions.<br><br>"Writing the Intimate Character, the latest engaging guide by Jordan Rosenfeld, is a rich resource we'll all be learning from for the rest of our lives. 'Does the term point of view seem too dull and dry?' she asks. 'Try intimacy instead.' And then she shows us how, with diverse examples and wise observation. Now that I have Jordan's take on how to create a character from the inside out, I'm eager to get to it. You, too, will find this book that inspiring." —Rebecca Lawton, author of Sacrament: Homage to a River and other books<br><br>"Writing the Intimate Character provides insights, examples, and exercises that will be useful not only to those who are new to writing fiction but to those, like myself, who are coming back to it after a break. Jordan Rosenfeld's explanation of how narrative voice works with point of view and other literary elements to create characters that readers care deeply about is clear and revelatory. The book can be worked through methodically or dipped into as needed. It's a useful tool for getting the gears of imagination working or for jump-starting and fine-tuning a work in process." —Zoe Zolbrod, author of the novel Currency and the memoir The Telling<br><br>"Jordan Rosenfeld has a keen insight into how to construct characters who are truly lived-in. With intelligence and wit, she walks you through every element of powerful characterization, from selecting your POV to demonstrating character growth throughout your story. Whether you're new to fiction or a more experienced writer, put your trust in Jordan Rosenfeld; she'll help you tell a better story." —Laura Bogart, freelance writer and novelist</p></div><!-- End description for Writing the Intimate Character: Create Unique, Compelling Characters Through Mastery of Point of View --><span class="asin">144034602X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium42C8BBC8-FAF6-4ADD-A358-FA98B32202FA"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('42C8BBC8-FAF6-4ADD-A358-FA98B32202FA');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/42C8BBC8-FAF6-4ADD-A358-FA98B32202FA-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626921644?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Citrus Vol. 3</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Saburouta&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Saburouta  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Yuzuko Aihara, a high school girl whose main interests are fashion, friends and having fun, is about to get a reality check.

It turned out to be a very long speech, lasting over eight and a half hours. And it hit a nerve. Millions followed the speech online until the traffic crashed the Senate server. A huge, positive grassroots response tied up the phones in the senator’s offices in Vermont and Washington. President Obama reportedly held an impromptu press conference with former President Clinton to deflect media attention away from Sander' speech. Editorials and news coverage appeared throughout the world.<br><br>In his speech, Sanders blasted the agreement that President Obama struck with Republicans, which extended the Bush tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, lowered estate tax rates for the very, very rich, and set a terrible precedent by establishing a "payroll tax holiday" diverting revenue away from the Social Security Trust Fund, threatening the fund’s very future. But the speech was more than a critique of a particular piece of legislation. It was a dissection of the collapse of the American middle class and a well-researched attack on corporate greed and on public policy which, over the last several decades, has led to a huge growth in millionaires even as the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. It was a plea for a fundamental change in national priorities, for government policy that reflects the needs of working families, and not just the wealthy and their lobbyists.<br><br>Finally, Sanders' speech-published here in its entirety with a new introduction by the senator-is a call for action. It is a passionate statement informing us that the only people who will save the middle class of this country is the middle class itself, but only if it is informed, organized, and prepared to take on the enormously powerful special interests dominating Washington.</p></div><!-- End description for The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class --><span class="asin">1568586841</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium361D88D0-9A87-46A8-88C3-8BDF87954DD9"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('361D88D0-9A87-46A8-88C3-8BDF87954DD9');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/361D88D0-9A87-46A8-88C3-8BDF87954DD9-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1612435009?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The 5 A.M.
