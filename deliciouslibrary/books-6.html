He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br><br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br><br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p></div><!-- End description for Steve Jobs --><span class="asin">1451648537</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumC4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('C4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/C4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568-256.png" width="185" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626924686?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Kindred Spirits on the Roof: The Complete Collection</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Hachi%20Ito%0AAya%20Fumio&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Hachi Ito, Aya Fumio  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a yuri manga omnibus based on a bestselling visual novel game of the same title.

Can the two girls go back to their relationship the way it was before, or are they ready for it to evolve into something else?

Here is stunning evidence that Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colón, with more than sixty years of experience in the comic-book industry between them, were right: far, far too few Americans have read, grasped, and demanded action on the Commission's investigation into the events of that tragic day and the lessons America must learn.<br><br>Using every skill and storytelling method Jacobson and Colón have learned over the decades, they have produced the most accessible version of the 9/11 Report. Jacobson's text frequently follows word for word the original report, faithfully captures its investigative thoroughness, and covers its entire scope, even including the Commission's final report card. Colón's stunning artwork powerfully conveys the facts, insights, and urgency of the original. Published on the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, an event that has left no aspect of American foreign or domestic policy untouched, The 9/11 Report puts at every American's fingertips the most defining event of the century.</p></div><!-- End description for The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation --><span class="asin">0809057395</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium6BE422D3-FEFF-465B-840A-6F5DF1107885"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('6BE422D3-FEFF-465B-840A-6F5DF1107885');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/6BE422D3-FEFF-465B-840A-6F5DF1107885-256.png" width="170" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470316608?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">House and Philosophy: Everybody Lies</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Henry%20Jacoby%0AWilliam%20Irwin&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Henry Jacoby, William Irwin  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>An unauthorized look at the philosophical issues raised by one of today's most popular television shows: House House is one of the top three television dramas on the air, pulling in more than 19 million viewers for each episode.

Finally giving us the concepts to discern why assholes disturb us so, philosopher Aaron James presents a provocative theory of the asshole to explain why such people exist, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism. We get a better sense of when the asshole is best resisted and best ignored—a better sense of what is, and what is not, worth fighting for.</p></div><!-- End description for Assholes: A Theory --><span class="asin">0804171351</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium98EAD074-4C26-44F0-ADE8-BCDD93B25E8F"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('98EAD074-4C26-44F0-ADE8-BCDD93B25E8F');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/98EAD074-4C26-44F0-ADE8-BCDD93B25E8F-256.png" width="177" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1450400248?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Yoga Anatomy-2nd Edition</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Leslie%20Kaminoff%0AAmy%20Matthews&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Leslie Kaminoff, Amy Matthews  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The best-selling anatomy guide for yoga is now updated, expanded, and better than ever!<br><br>With more asanas, vinyasas, full-color anatomical illustrations, and in-depth information, the second edition of Yoga Anatomy provides you with a deeper understanding of the structures and principles underlying each movement and of yoga itself.<br><br>From breathing to inversions to standing poses, see how specific muscles respond to the movements of the joints; how alterations of a pose can enhance or reduce effectiveness; and how the spine, breathing, and body position are all fundamentally linked.<br><br>Whether you are just beginning your journey or have been practicing yoga for years, Yoga Anatomy will be an invaluable resource—one that allows you to see each movement in an entirely new light.<br><br>With Yoga Anatomy, Second Edition, authors Leslie Kaminoff and Amy Matthews, both internationally recognized experts and teachers in anatomy, breathing, and bodywork, have created the ultimate reference for yoga practitioners, instructors, and enthusiasts alike.</p></div><!-- End description for Yoga Anatomy-2nd Edition --><span class="asin">1450400248</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-5.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-4.html">4</a> <a class="page" href="books-5.html">5</a> <span class="page">6</span> <a class="page" href="books-7.html">7</a> <a class="page" href="books-8.html">8</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-7.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
