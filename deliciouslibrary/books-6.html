DeSalvo advises her readers to explore their creative process on deeper levels by getting to know themselves and their stories more fully over a longer period of time. She writes in the same supportive manner that encourages her students, using the slow writing process to help them explore the complexities of craft. The Art of Slow Writing is the antidote to self-help books that preach the idea of fast-writing, finishing a novel a year, and quick revisions. DeSalvo makes a case that more mature writing often develops over a longer period of time and offers tips and techniques to train the creative process in this new experience.<br><br>DeSalvo describes the work habits of successful writers (among them, Nobel Prize laureates) so that readers can use the information provided to develop their identity as writers and transform their writing lives. It includes anecdotes from classic American and international writers such as John Steinbeck, Henry Miller, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence as well as contemporary authors such as Michael Chabon, Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides, Ian McEwan, and Salman Rushdie. DeSalvo skillfully and gently guides writers to not only start their work, but immerse themselves fully in the process and create texts they will treasure.</p></div><!-- End description for The Art of Slow Writing: Reflections on Time, Craft, and Creativity --><span class="asin">1250051037</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium6A0C18C5-B616-4E7B-A116-09FAD9CED3E1"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('6A0C18C5-B616-4E7B-A116-09FAD9CED3E1');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/6A0C18C5-B616-4E7B-A116-09FAD9CED3E1-256.png" width="165" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399154469?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Fatal Revenant</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stephen%20R.%20Donaldson&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stephen R.

As Fatal Revenant begins, Linden watches from the battlements of Revelstone when the impossible happens-riding ahead of the hordes attacking Revelstone are Jeremiah and Covenant himself, apparently very much alive.<br><br>Here in the Land, Jeremiah is healed of the mental condition that had kept him mute and unresponsive for so many years. He is full of life, and devoted to Covenant. But Covenant is strangely changed. Sarcastic and bragging, he no longer seems like the man whom Linden adored. And yet he says he has a plan: he will take her and Jeremiah to a place where they can find a pure source of Earthpower and, after he has achieved his own purposes, Linden will be free to use that great power to go home, to take Jeremiah home, or to do anything else she sees fit. Even though she distrusts the seemingly different man he has now become, how can she make any choice except to follow him?<br><br>Their journey will cover unimaginable distances through the Land-even through time itself-and will test Linden's courage again and again. In the end, fulfilling her destiny will call for a terrible leap of faith: Can she give up everything she thought had been restored to her, for the sake of the Land?</p></div><!-- End description for Fatal Revenant --><span class="asin">0399154469</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4-256.png" width="170" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060621796?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Living Judaism: The Complete Guide to Jewish Belief, Tradition, and Practice</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Wayne%20D.%20Dosick&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Wayne D.

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists.

It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.<br> <br>“What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?<br> <br>“I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.<br> <br>“Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion.

The stories reflect not only the beliefs of various literary schools, but the preoccupations of French civilization, at the various times of their composition, with the metaphysical and psychological problems of man. Contents include Micromégas (Voltaire), La Messe de l'Athée (Honoré de Balzac), La Légende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier (Gustave Flaubert), Le Spleen de Paris (Charles Baudelaire), Menuet (Guy de Maupassant), Mort de Judas (Paul Claudel), Le Retour de l'Enfant Prodigue (André Gide), Grand-Lebrun (François Mauriac), Le Passe-Muraille (Marcel Aymé), and L'Hôte (Albert Camus). Students of French, or those who wish to refresh their knowledge of the language, will welcome this treasury of masterly fiction. The selections are arranged chronologically, allowing the reader to witness the development of French literary art — from Voltaire to Camus. Excellent English translations appear on pages facing the original French. Also included are a French-English vocabulary list, textual notes, and exercises.</p></div><!-- End description for French Stories / Contes Français --><span class="asin">0486264432</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium5B5AA250-E7D2-423B-9EEF-C821392DB79E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('5B5AA250-E7D2-423B-9EEF-C821392DB79E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/5B5AA250-E7D2-423B-9EEF-C821392DB79E-256.png" width="209" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1623157595?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Complete Paleo Slow Cooker: A Paleo Cookbook for Everyday Meals That Prep Fast &amp; Cook Slow</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Karen%20Frazier&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Karen Frazier  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Taste all of the benefits of Paleo in half the time with The Complete Paleo Slow Cooker cookbook.<br><br>Favored by home chefs for years, the slow cooker remains a kitchen staple in many homes today―with good reason!
