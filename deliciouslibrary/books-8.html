The status quo is no longer an option.<br><br>In This Changes Everything Naomi Klein argues that climate change isn’t just another issue to be neatly filed between taxes and health care. It’s an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways. Klein meticulously builds the case for how massively reducing our greenhouse emissions is our best chance to simultaneously reduce gaping inequalities, re-imagine our broken democracies, and rebuild our gutted local economies. She exposes the ideological desperation of the climate-change deniers, the messianic delusions of the would-be geoengineers, and the tragic defeatism of too many mainstream green initiatives. And she demonstrates precisely why the market has not—and cannot—fix the climate crisis but will instead make things worse, with ever more extreme and ecologically damaging extraction methods, accompanied by rampant disaster capitalism.<br><br>Klein argues that the changes to our relationship with nature and one another that are required to respond to the climate crisis humanely should not be viewed as grim penance, but rather as a kind of gift—a catalyst to transform broken economic and cultural priorities and to heal long-festering historical wounds. And she documents the inspiring movements that have already begun this process: communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel extraction but are building the next, regeneration-based economies right now.<br><br>Can we pull off these changes in time? Nothing is certain. Nothing except that climate change changes everything. And for a very brief time, the nature of that change is still up to us.</p></div><!-- End description for This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate --><span class="asin">1451697384</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium166F2B89-0F26-4E0C-8748-97802505C7D3"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('166F2B89-0F26-4E0C-8748-97802505C7D3');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/166F2B89-0F26-4E0C-8748-97802505C7D3-256.png" width="175" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580088732?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Grown-Up's Guide to Running Away from Home, Second Edition: Making a New Life Abroad</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Rosanne%20Knorr&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Rosanne Knorr  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>For empty-nesters, early retirees, and even established executives, midlife is the ideal time to turn travel fantasies into real and rewarding experiences.

In this entirely new kind of photography guide, written by Mr. Lange and Scott Mowbray, magazine editor and longtime amateur photographer, the rest of us will learn how to take photographs that don’t just document life but celebrate it.<br><br>No fancy equipment required. Just hundreds of simple, inspiring ideas and lessons―each one illustrated with a photograph―organized around the six essential principles of seeing like a photographer. (Here’s one: Shoot the Moment, Not the Subject.)<br><br>Here’s why to shoot in natural light―always. The fun of putting babies in surprising places. How to get intimate with food. Using a dramatic sky as your backdrop. The benefit of learning to know the light in every room of your house. Shooting hands or feet instead of faces. How to move past the “I was here” postcard effect. How to catch the in-between moments. Because in the end, it’s about living the moment, shooting the moment―and being in the moment forever.</p></div><!-- End description for The Unforgettable Photograph: 228 Ideas, Tips, and Secrets for Taking the Best Pictures of Your Life --><span class="asin">0761169237</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumBC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('BC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/BC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4-256.png" width="256" height="253"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0770434037?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Beautiful Mess Photo Idea Book: 95 Inspiring Ideas for Photographing Your Friends, Your World, and Yourself</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Elsie%20Larson%0AEmma%20Chapman&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Elsie Larson, Emma Chapman  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Ready to show your photos some love?<br> <br>Whether it’s of your sister’s smile, your morning coffee, or your new puppy, photos are a way to connect on Facebook and Instagram, keep a visual diary of our lives, and create momentos for future generations.
