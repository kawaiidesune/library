Great companies are made, not born. The secret is hiring the right people—the "A" players. This is, of course, easier said than done. Statistically, half of all employment situations result in a mis-hire; the wrong person for the wrong job. And with the cost of a mis-hire at twenty-four times salary, the financial drain can be staggering! Compare that with Brad Smart's 90% success rate and understand why topgraded organizations such as General Electric and Allied Signal consistently beat the competition. In this unparalleled work, Dr. Smart introduces readers to the tograding concept—how and why it works. The author sets forth principles which hold true for Fortune 500 companies as well as small emerging companies. Topgrading is a silver bullet—the corporate initiative that empowers all other corporate initiatives. The author spells out his practical hands-on approach and provides intriguing case studies culled from his file of more than 4,000 in-depth interviews. Topgrading's expert coaching techniques are also revealed and readers learn how managers who topgrade become leaders, achieving success and excellence not only for their companies, but also for themselves. This book is not without controversy, however, as Brad discusses how those who don't pull their own weight, the chronic "C" players, must step aside, be redeployed, or terminated.</p></div><!-- End description for Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching and Keeping the Best People --><span class="asin">0735200491</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumFF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('FF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/FF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3-256.png" width="166" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610693132?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=David%20E.%20Newton%20Ph.D.&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">David E.

Interestingly, the use of steroids to boost human performance stretches back to ancient times. Written by a former professor of chemistry, Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook provides not only information about all aspects of performance-enhancing drugs in sport, but also supplies a thorough, scientific background about the drugs themselves—the chemistry and biology of steroids, what scientists have learned about these substances, and the specific ways in which they affect the human body.<br><br>The author documents the cat-and-mouse actions of the athletes and those who supply them with performance-enhancing drugs to push the envelope, and of the sport and athletic groups—such as the NCAA and the International Cycling Union—that try to monitor and control such drug use. The work also includes a chapter containing snapshot profiles of many individuals involved in steroid use scandals and organizations with an interest in topics related to steroid abuse.</p></div><!-- End description for Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook --><span class="asin">1610693132</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumC59D2BA2-F3E5-4AA8-A715-9378432DC7BC"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('C59D2BA2-F3E5-4AA8-A715-9378432DC7BC');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/C59D2BA2-F3E5-4AA8-A715-9378432DC7BC-256.png" width="164" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1502542714?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">How To Run The European Parliament</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Marilyn%20Political&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Marilyn Political  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>DESCRIPTION AND REVIEWS BY POLITICAL LEADERS:<br><br>How do you gain influence and publicity in the European Parliament?

It turned out to be a very long speech, lasting over eight and a half hours. And it hit a nerve. Millions followed the speech online until the traffic crashed the Senate server. A huge, positive grassroots response tied up the phones in the senator’s offices in Vermont and Washington. President Obama reportedly held an impromptu press conference with former President Clinton to deflect media attention away from Sander' speech. Editorials and news coverage appeared throughout the world.<br><br>In his speech, Sanders blasted the agreement that President Obama struck with Republicans, which extended the Bush tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, lowered estate tax rates for the very, very rich, and set a terrible precedent by establishing a "payroll tax holiday" diverting revenue away from the Social Security Trust Fund, threatening the fund’s very future. But the speech was more than a critique of a particular piece of legislation. It was a dissection of the collapse of the American middle class and a well-researched attack on corporate greed and on public policy which, over the last several decades, has led to a huge growth in millionaires even as the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. It was a plea for a fundamental change in national priorities, for government policy that reflects the needs of working families, and not just the wealthy and their lobbyists.<br><br>Finally, Sanders' speech-published here in its entirety with a new introduction by the senator-is a call for action. It is a passionate statement informing us that the only people who will save the middle class of this country is the middle class itself, but only if it is informed, organized, and prepared to take on the enormously powerful special interests dominating Washington.</p></div><!-- End description for The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class --><span class="asin">1568586841</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-8.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-7.html">7</a> <a class="page" href="books-8.html">8</a> <span class="page">9</span> <a class="page" href="books-10.html">10</a> <a class="page" href="books-11.html">11</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-10.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
