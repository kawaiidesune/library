These characters also appear in genre pieces, accessible to the mainstream, instead of being hidden away in so-called "worthier" pieces, as in the past. This book discusses issues of race, disability, sexuality, and transgender people with specific reference to characterization in movies, TV, and novel writing. Using such examples as the film Mad Max: Fury Road and the novel Gone Girl, the book explores how character role function really works. It discusses such questions as the difference between stereotype and archetype, why "trope" does not mean what Twitter and Tumblr think it means, how the burden of casting affects both box office and audience perception, and why diversity is not about agendas, buzzwords or being "politically correct." It also goes into what authenticity truly means, and why research is so important; why variety is key in ensuring true diversity in characterization; and what agents, publishers, producers, filmmakers, and commissioners are looking for—and why.</p></div><!-- End description for Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film --><span class="asin">0857301179</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumAC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588991962?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Onegai Teacher Book 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Shizuru%20Hayashiya&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Shizuru Hayashiya  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>ONEGAI TEACHER VOL.1<br><br>Kei Kusanagi was your typical ordinary senior in High School.

Contributors also describe the development of nature-based theo/alogy within Unitarian Universalism including the organization of the Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans, the addition of the sixth Source to the UUA bylaws recognizing Earth-centered spirituality, and the integration of Pagan practices into congregational life.</p></div><!-- End description for Pagan and Earth-Centered Voices in Unitarian Universalism --><span class="asin">1558967958</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumF8CD7133-D58C-42C1-9210-B0727C43BC63"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('F8CD7133-D58C-42C1-9210-B0727C43BC63');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F8CD7133-D58C-42C1-9210-B0727C43BC63-256.png" width="189" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802834132?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=William%20L%20Holladay&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">William L Holladay  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Strictly alphabetical listing of words written in Hebrew letters, followed by some inflectional forms of the word, its English meaning, and relevant chapter and verse citations from the Bible.</p></div><!-- End description for A Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament --><span class="asin">0802834132</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium692E9F44-FBB6-458D-ADCA-754456B446E9"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('692E9F44-FBB6-458D-ADCA-754456B446E9');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/692E9F44-FBB6-458D-ADCA-754456B446E9-256.png" width="173" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1619865750?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Writers of the Future Vol 34: #1 Bestselling Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy Short Stories of the Year</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=L.%20Ron%20Hubbard%0ABrandon%20Sanderson%0AJody%20Lynn%20Nye%0AOrson%20Scott%20Card%0AJerry%20Pournelle%0AEcho%20Chernik%0AErik%20Bundy%0AErin%20Cairns%0AJonathan%20Ficke%0AJeremy%20TeGrotenhuis%0AVida%20Cruz%0ADarci%20Stone%0ACole%20Hehr%0AJaney%20Bell%0AEneasz%20Brodski%0AN.R.M.%20Roshak%0ADiana%20Hart%0AAmy%20Henrie%20Gillett&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">L.
