Many fans of manga don't realize that their favorite comics, like Priest, Ragnarock, and Island, are actually manhwa, not Japanese manga. This tutorial helps artists master the differences between manga and manhwa, including less focus on big eyes and more on expressions and personality, replacing spiky hair with a more natural look, and drawing characters that don't typically possess magical powers but are instead fierce fighters made of flesh and blood. Artists learn through a step-by-step process how to draw the entire range of manhwa characters-from the extreme fighting-machine heroes and giant beasts to the sexy women, anti-heroes, and evil warlords.</p></div><!-- End description for Manhwa Mania: How to Draw Korean Comics --><span class="asin">082302976X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A-256.png" width="164" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0857301179?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Lucy%20V.%20Hay&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Lucy V.

These characters also appear in genre pieces, accessible to the mainstream, instead of being hidden away in so-called "worthier" pieces, as in the past. This book discusses issues of race, disability, sexuality, and transgender people with specific reference to characterization in movies, TV, and novel writing. Using such examples as the film Mad Max: Fury Road and the novel Gone Girl, the book explores how character role function really works. It discusses such questions as the difference between stereotype and archetype, why "trope" does not mean what Twitter and Tumblr think it means, how the burden of casting affects both box office and audience perception, and why diversity is not about agendas, buzzwords or being "politically correct." It also goes into what authenticity truly means, and why research is so important; why variety is key in ensuring true diversity in characterization; and what agents, publishers, producers, filmmakers, and commissioners are looking for—and why.</p></div><!-- End description for Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film --><span class="asin">0857301179</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumAC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588991962?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Onegai Teacher Book 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Shizuru%20Hayashiya&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Shizuru Hayashiya  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>ONEGAI TEACHER VOL.1<br><br>Kei Kusanagi was your typical ordinary senior in High School.
