From remotely controlling the overhead paging system of a large supermarket, to confusing the phone company with various call forwarding stunts, this bizarre collection of pranks will not only make you laugh, but will make you question the security and sanity of common, everyday business procedures. Learn how one illustrious member of the PLA crossed the country on stolen credit cards, staying in the nicest hotels one day and then sleeping on the streets of major cities the next, all while amusing himself at the expense of others. Laugh as he turns a radio morning show into his own interactive game, enrages users of an online auction site, uses revenge tactics that cross the line, systematically drives convenience store employees nuts so that he can get a job, and confuses an entire neighborhood of cordless phone users. The stories contained in this book are based on the writings from the Phone Losers of America website which have been featured in USA Today, the Boston Herald, 2600, on CNBC, CNN, TechTV, and countless other websites, books, magazines, radio shows and police reports.</p></div><!-- End description for Phone Losers of America --><span class="asin">1452876169</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7-256.png" width="184" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/078582944X?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Nigel%20Cawthorne&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Nigel Cawthorne  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Despite being incredibly popular during his time, Nikola Tesla today remains largely overlooked among lists of the greatest inventors and scientists of the modern era. Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<br><br>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<br><br>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.</p></div><!-- End description for Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah --><span class="asin">078582944X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C-256.png" width="177" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975914723?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Raymond Chandler  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Book on Michael Jackson All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</p></div><!-- End description for All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up --><span class="asin">0975914723</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1958FBDB-CE61-434E-BA03-0DF51494A803-256.png" width="173" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1595824510?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Chobits, Vol. 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Clamp&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Clamp  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Some people buy their personal computers based on style... and in near-future Japan, the hottest style for your "persocom" is shaped like an attractive android!

You’ll win here. But it’ll be the only damn place you win in this county.” (He was right on both counts.)<br><br>• The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign.<br><br>• The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole.<br><br>• The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin.<br><br>• The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency.<br><br>Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice.

Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”<br><br>In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.<br><br>Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.<br><br>By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.<br><br>Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.</p></div><!-- End description for Hard Choices --><span class="asin">1476751447</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium1B92B84E-1EFF-48B7-9498-00451EFB2C8E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('1B92B84E-1EFF-48B7-9498-00451EFB2C8E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/1B92B84E-1EFF-48B7-9498-00451EFB2C8E-256.png" width="191" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307587789?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Joy of Sex: The Ultimate Revised Edition</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Alex%20Comfort&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Alex Comfort  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Famous for helping couples discover how sex can be playful, erotic, passionate, exhilarating, and most of all, pleasurable.<br><br>The Joy of Sex revolutionized how we experience our sexuality.

Make sure your next production deployment goes smoothly with this hands-on book, which guides you through the entire production process. You'll set up scripts to install and configure all the software your servers need, including your application code. Once you're in production, you'll learn how to set up systems to monitor your application's health, gather metrics so you can stop problems before they start, and fix things when they go wrong.<br><br>Deploying Rails takes you on a expertly guided tour of the current best practices in Rails deployment and management. You'll find in-depth explanations on effectively running a Rails app by leveraging popular open source tools such as Puppet, Capistrano, and Vagrant. Then you'll go beyond deployment and learn how to use Ganglia and Nagios to monitor your application's health and gather metrics so you can head off problems before they happen.<br><br>You'll start out by building your own virtual environment by writing scripts to provision a production server with Vagrant and Puppet. Then you'll leverage the popular Rails deployment tool Capistrano to deploy an application into this infrastructure. Once the app is live, you'll monitor your application's health with Nagios, and configure Ganglia to collect system metrics.
