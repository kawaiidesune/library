Many fans of manga don't realize that their favorite comics, like Priest, Ragnarock, and Island, are actually manhwa, not Japanese manga. This tutorial helps artists master the differences between manga and manhwa, including less focus on big eyes and more on expressions and personality, replacing spiky hair with a more natural look, and drawing characters that don't typically possess magical powers but are instead fierce fighters made of flesh and blood. Artists learn through a step-by-step process how to draw the entire range of manhwa characters-from the extreme fighting-machine heroes and giant beasts to the sexy women, anti-heroes, and evil warlords.</p></div><!-- End description for Manhwa Mania: How to Draw Korean Comics --><span class="asin">082302976X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/8E8A7715-DB79-4D12-893A-15A43CD8CD0A-256.png" width="164" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0857301179?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Lucy%20V.%20Hay&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Lucy V.

These characters also appear in genre pieces, accessible to the mainstream, instead of being hidden away in so-called "worthier" pieces, as in the past. This book discusses issues of race, disability, sexuality, and transgender people with specific reference to characterization in movies, TV, and novel writing. Using such examples as the film Mad Max: Fury Road and the novel Gone Girl, the book explores how character role function really works. It discusses such questions as the difference between stereotype and archetype, why "trope" does not mean what Twitter and Tumblr think it means, how the burden of casting affects both box office and audience perception, and why diversity is not about agendas, buzzwords or being "politically correct." It also goes into what authenticity truly means, and why research is so important; why variety is key in ensuring true diversity in characterization; and what agents, publishers, producers, filmmakers, and commissioners are looking for—and why.</p></div><!-- End description for Writing Diverse Characters for Fiction, TV or Film --><span class="asin">0857301179</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumAC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/AC433714-112D-4FCB-84BA-0E19C373753E-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588991962?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Onegai Teacher Book 1</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Shizuru%20Hayashiya&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Shizuru Hayashiya  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>ONEGAI TEACHER VOL.1<br><br>Kei Kusanagi was your typical ordinary senior in High School.

How do you write a kissing book?<br><br>Writing a well-structured romance isn't the same as writing any other genre—something the popular novel and screenwriting guides don't address. The romance arc is made up of its own story beats, and the external plot and theme need to be braided to the romance arc—not the other way around.<br><br>Told in conversational (and often irreverent) prose, Romancing the Beat can be read like you are sitting down to coffee with romance editor and author Gwen Hayes while she explains story structure. The way she does with her clients. Some of whom are regular inhabitants of the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists.<br><br>Romancing the Beat is a recipe, not a rigid system. The beats don't care if you plot or outline before you write, or if you pants your way through the drafts and do a "beat check" when you're revising. Pantsers and plotters are both welcome. So sit down, grab a cuppa, and let's talk about kissing books.<br><br>For free Scrivener template and plotting printables to use with the book, please visit the author's website: gwenhayes.com/free-stuff</p></div><!-- End description for Romancing the Beat: Story Structure for Romance Novels --><span class="asin">1530838614</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumF1F40739-5B91-4B11-9EC8-03683D199807"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('F1F40739-5B91-4B11-9EC8-03683D199807');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/F1F40739-5B91-4B11-9EC8-03683D199807-256.png" width="197" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071819541?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Practice Makes Perfect: Complete French All-in-One</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Annie%20Heminway&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Annie Heminway  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Get five times the language-learning expertise for the price of one book!More than a million students have turned to the Practice Makes Perfect series for a trusted guide to help build their language-learning skills.
