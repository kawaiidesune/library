In this edition, author Kristin Cullen tackles the often perplexing job of nailing down a layout that works. More than a collection of great examples, this book is a valuable resource for students, designers, and creative professionals who seek design understanding and inspiration. The book illuminates the broad category of layout, communicating specifically what it takes to design with excellence. It also addresses the how and why of the creative process. Cullen approaches layout with a series of step-by-step fundamental chapters addressing topics such as design function, inspiration, process, intuition, structure, organization, the interaction of visual elements, typography, and design analysis.</p></div><!-- End description for Layout Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Building Pages in Graphic Design --><span class="asin">1592533523</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium8BB312C8-5D92-4E58-9B93-D0899F875A19"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('8BB312C8-5D92-4E58-9B93-D0899F875A19');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/8BB312C8-5D92-4E58-9B93-D0899F875A19-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1631211633?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Moon Living Abroad France</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Aurelia%20d%27Andrea&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Aurelia d'Andrea  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Moon Living Abroad France</p></div><!-- End description for Moon Living Abroad France --><span class="asin">1631211633</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium9E1022EB-FE0B-42E7-AABD-9AADFF21AEB4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('9E1022EB-FE0B-42E7-AABD-9AADFF21AEB4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/9E1022EB-FE0B-42E7-AABD-9AADFF21AEB4-256.png" width="218" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307985504?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Pop Manga: How to Draw the Coolest, Cutest Characters, Animals, Mascots, and More</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Camilla%20D%27Errico%0AStephen%20W.%20Martin&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Camilla D'Errico, Stephen W.
