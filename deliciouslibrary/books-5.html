He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br><br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br><br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p></div><!-- End description for Steve Jobs --><span class="asin">1451648537</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC-256.png" width="161" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0809057395?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Sid%20Jacobson%0AErnie%20Col%C3%B3n&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Sid Jacobson, Ernie Colón  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The 9/11 Report for Every American<br><br>On December 5, 2005, the 9/11 Commission issued its final report card on the government's fulfillment of the recommendations issued in July 2004: one A, twelve Bs, nine Cs, twelve Ds, three Fs, and four incompletes. Here is stunning evidence that Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colón, with more than sixty years of experience in the comic-book industry between them, were right: far, far too few Americans have read, grasped, and demanded action on the Commission's investigation into the events of that tragic day and the lessons America must learn.<br><br>Using every skill and storytelling method Jacobson and Colón have learned over the decades, they have produced the most accessible version of the 9/11 Report. Jacobson's text frequently follows word for word the original report, faithfully captures its investigative thoroughness, and covers its entire scope, even including the Commission's final report card. Colón's stunning artwork powerfully conveys the facts, insights, and urgency of the original. Published on the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, an event that has left no aspect of American foreign or domestic policy untouched, The 9/11 Report puts at every American's fingertips the most defining event of the century.</p></div><!-- End description for The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation --><span class="asin">0809057395</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-4.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-3.html">3</a> <a class="page" href="books-4.html">4</a> <span class="page">5</span> <a class="page" href="books-6.html">6</a> <a class="page" href="books-7.html">7</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-6.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
