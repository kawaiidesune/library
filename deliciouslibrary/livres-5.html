To Stalin, he was such a threat that he warranted murder by pickax. This polarizing figure set up a world conflict that lasted through the twentieth century, and in Trotsky: A Graphic Biography, the renowned comic artist Rick Geary uses his distinct style to depict the stark reality of the man and his times. Trotsky's life becomes a guide to the creation of the Soviet Union, the horrors of World War I, and the establishment of international communism as he, Lenin, and their fellow Bolsheviks rise from persecution and a life underground to the height of political power. Ranging from his boyhood in the Ukraine to his fallout with Stalin and his moonlight romance with Frida Kahlo, Trotsky is a stunning look at one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers and the far-reaching political trends that he launched.</p></div><!-- End description for Trotsky: A Graphic Biography --><span class="asin">0809095084</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920-256.png" width="181" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0931779618?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Jefferson Bible for the Twenty-first Century</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Luis%20Granados%0ARoy%20Speckhardt&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Luis Granados, Roy Speckhardt  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Paperback: 194 pages Publisher: Humanist Press;

what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.  Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.<br> <br>In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.  Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives.  And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.  This remarkable book will start you on your way.</p></div><!-- End description for The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future --><span class="asin">0307951529</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C-256.png" width="188" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399536108?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Chris%20Guillebeau&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Chris Guillebeau  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>If you've ever thought, "There must be more to life than this," The Art of Non-Conformity is for you.<br><br>Based on Chris Guillebeau's popular online manifesto "A Brief Guide to World Domination," The Art of Non-Conformity defies common assumptions about life and work while arming you with the tools to live differently.

For the first time, Harding brings together the many sources and strands of the story—touching on everything from concerns about domestic spying to the complicity of the tech sector—while also placing us in the room with Edward Snowden himself.
