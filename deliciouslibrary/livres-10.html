He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  <br><br>Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br><br>Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.</p></div><!-- End description for Steve Jobs --><span class="asin">1451648537</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumC4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('C4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/C4E3160D-172F-4152-BE06-A048D4901568-256.png" width="185" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1626924686?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Kindred Spirits on the Roof: The Complete Collection</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Hachi%20Ito%0AAya%20Fumio&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Hachi Ito, Aya Fumio  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a yuri manga omnibus based on a bestselling visual novel game of the same title. The story follows multiple schoolgirl romances with some ghostly interference! Two friendly spirits inhabit the rooftop of an all-girls' school and, inspired by their own feelings of unrequited love for each other, try to make more yuri couples among the living students. The Kindred Spirits on the Roof game has been localised into English by MangaGamer and is available for download on the popular digital game platform, Steam. Kindred Spirits on the Roof, the manga, features adorable artwork, charming love stories, and unforgettable characters that are spun-off directly from the digital game. This omnibus contains the complete two-volume manga series, along with multiple full-colour inserts, and will be adored by fans of such titles as Girl Friends and Strawberry Panic. Mako and Shiori have been best friends since they were children, but when Mako suddenly confesses her love to Shiori, all Shiori can do is run away! One year later, Shiori sees Mako and decides she wants to rekindle their friendship. Can the two girls go back to their relationship the way it was before, or are they ready for it to evolve into something else? Meanwhile, fellow student Hase Chiharu loves seeing yuri romance play out. For that reason, she becomes enamored by two senior classmates, Natsuki and Rika, a power couple in the school's Quiz Show Club. When Chiharu joins the club so she can be closer to them, she meets the adorable Tokino. Tokino can't take her eyes off their beautiful upper classmates either, and as Chiharu and Tokino observe the couple together, their own sweet relationship begins!</p></div><!-- End description for Kindred Spirits on the Roof: The Complete Collection --><span class="asin">1626924686</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/22345DA9-CB77-4CB8-8976-CBAD074BFAEC-256.png" width="161" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0809057395?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Sid%20Jacobson%0AErnie%20Col%C3%B3n&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Sid Jacobson, Ernie Colón  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The 9/11 Report for Every American<br><br>On December 5, 2005, the 9/11 Commission issued its final report card on the government's fulfillment of the recommendations issued in July 2004: one A, twelve Bs, nine Cs, twelve Ds, three Fs, and four incompletes.

Finally giving us the concepts to discern why assholes disturb us so, philosopher Aaron James presents a provocative theory of the asshole to explain why such people exist, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism.

Technology can't fix it, and shopping—no matter how green—won’t stop it. To save this planet, we need a serious resistance movement that can bring down the industrial economy. Deep Green Resistance evaluates strategic options for resistance, from nonviolence to guerrilla warfare, and the conditions required for those options to be successful. It provides an exploration of organizational structures, recruitment, security, and target selection for both aboveground and underground action.
