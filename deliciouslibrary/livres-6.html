Colón's stunning artwork powerfully conveys the facts, insights, and urgency of the original.

Finally giving us the concepts to discern why assholes disturb us so, philosopher Aaron James presents a provocative theory of the asshole to explain why such people exist, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism.

Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it—fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p></div><!-- End description for On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft --><span class="asin">1439156816</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumE2A644F6-C790-4096-AD0C-12278E4E4CB2"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('E2A644F6-C790-4096-AD0C-12278E4E4CB2');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E2A644F6-C790-4096-AD0C-12278E4E4CB2-256.png" width="141" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416521496?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Song of Susannah</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stephen%20King&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stephen King  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Soon to be a major motion picture starring Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba<br><br>The penultimate volume in the Dark Tower series, The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah, a #1 New York Times bestseller, is a pivotal installment in the epic saga.<br><br>Susannah Dean is possessed, her body a living vessel for the demon-mother Mia.

Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day’s trials by reciting a story from the Magic Tales of the Eld that his mother often read to him at bedtime. “A person’s never too old for stories,” Roland says to Bill. “Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old.
