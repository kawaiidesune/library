DeSalvo advises her readers to explore their creative process on deeper levels by getting to know themselves and their stories more fully over a longer period of time. She writes in the same supportive manner that encourages her students, using the slow writing process to help them explore the complexities of craft. The Art of Slow Writing is the antidote to self-help books that preach the idea of fast-writing, finishing a novel a year, and quick revisions. DeSalvo makes a case that more mature writing often develops over a longer period of time and offers tips and techniques to train the creative process in this new experience.<br><br>DeSalvo describes the work habits of successful writers (among them, Nobel Prize laureates) so that readers can use the information provided to develop their identity as writers and transform their writing lives. It includes anecdotes from classic American and international writers such as John Steinbeck, Henry Miller, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence as well as contemporary authors such as Michael Chabon, Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides, Ian McEwan, and Salman Rushdie. DeSalvo skillfully and gently guides writers to not only start their work, but immerse themselves fully in the process and create texts they will treasure.</p></div><!-- End description for The Art of Slow Writing: Reflections on Time, Craft, and Creativity --><span class="asin">1250051037</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumD207C287-EB6C-44FD-9C45-9FBC47C335D4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('D207C287-EB6C-44FD-9C45-9FBC47C335D4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/D207C287-EB6C-44FD-9C45-9FBC47C335D4-256.png" width="248" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1606523589?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Most Scenic Drives in America, Newly Revised and Updated: 120 Spectacular Road Trips</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Editors%20of%20Reader%27s%20Digest&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Editors of Reader's Digest  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The all-in-one trip planner and travel guide-now totally revised and updated-will steer you down the most scenic road every time.<br><br>The all-in-one trip planner and travel guide-now totally revised and updated-will steer you down the most scenic road every time.

Even though she distrusts the seemingly different man he has now become, how can she make any choice except to follow him?<br><br>Their journey will cover unimaginable distances through the Land-even through time itself-and will test Linden's courage again and again.

With artist Lady Frieda Harris, he condensed the core of his teaching into the 78 cards of the tarot. Although Crowley's own Book of Thoth provides insight into the cards, it is a complicated, dated book. Now, in clear language, Lon Milo DuQuette provides everything you need to know to get the most out of using the Thoth deck.</p></div><!-- End description for Understanding Aleister Crowley&apos;s Thoth Tarot --><span class="asin">1578632765</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium65CD256B-52E2-41AE-865F-8CDB03A09EFC"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('65CD256B-52E2-41AE-865F-8CDB03A09EFC');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/65CD256B-52E2-41AE-865F-8CDB03A09EFC-256.png" width="173" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0300181531?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Why Marx Was Right</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Terry%20Eagleton&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Terry Eagleton  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>In this combative, controversial book, Terry Eagleton takes issue with the prejudice that Marxism is dead and done with. Taking ten of the most common objections to Marxism—that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so on—he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid.
