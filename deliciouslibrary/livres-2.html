Yet how did all this emerge from what was once an insignificant village in central Italy? In S.P.Q.R., world-renowned classicist Mary Beard narrates the unprecedented rise of a civilization that even two thousand years later still shapes many of our most fundamental assumptions about power, citizenship, responsibility, political violence, empire, luxury, and beauty.<br><br>From the foundational myth of Romulus and Remus to 212 ce―nearly a thousand years later―when the emperor Caracalla gave Roman citizenship to every free inhabitant of the empire, S.P.Q.R. (the abbreviation of "The Senate and People of Rome") examines not just how we think of ancient Rome but challenges the comfortable historical perspectives that have existed for centuries by exploring how the Romans thought of themselves: how they challenged the idea of imperial rule, how they responded to terrorism and revolution, and how they invented a new idea of citizenship and nation.<br><br>Opening the book in 63 bce with the famous clash between the populist aristocrat Catiline and Cicero, the renowned politician and orator, Beard animates this “terrorist conspiracy,” which was aimed at the very heart of the Republic, demonstrating how this singular event would presage the struggle between democracy and autocracy that would come to define much of Rome’s subsequent history. Illustrating how a classical democracy yielded to a self-confident and self-critical empire, S.P.Q.R. reintroduces us, though in a wholly different way, to famous and familiar characters―Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Augustus, and Nero, among others―while expanding the historical aperture to include those overlooked in traditional histories: the women, the slaves and ex-slaves, conspirators, and those on the losing side of Rome’s glorious conquests.<br><br>Like the best detectives, Beard sifts fact from fiction, myth and propaganda from historical record, refusing either simple admiration or blanket condemnation. Far from being frozen in marble, Roman history, she shows, is constantly being revised and rewritten as our knowledge expands. Indeed, our perceptions of ancient Rome have changed dramatically over the last fifty years, and S.P.Q.R., with its nuanced attention to class inequality, democratic struggles, and the lives of entire groups of people omitted from the historical narrative for centuries, promises to shape our view of Roman history for decades to come. 100 illustrations; 16 pages of color; 5 maps</p></div><!-- End description for SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome --><span class="asin">0871404230</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumC46AEEC5-3E85-40A2-B7DF-AE4CAD2E74A5"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('C46AEEC5-3E85-40A2-B7DF-AE4CAD2E74A5');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/C46AEEC5-3E85-40A2-B7DF-AE4CAD2E74A5-256.png" width="205" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0547333625?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Best American Comics 2011</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Alison%20Bechdel%0AJessica%20Abel%0AMatt%20Madden&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Alison Bechdel, Jessica Abel, Matt Madden  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>“If you have spent a long time resisting the status quo—whether it’s in art, society, or the political world—what happens when that status quo at last gives way?<br>A universe of possibility opens up.”<br>—Alison Bechdel, from the Introduction<br><br>Featuring: Gabrielle Bell, Joe Sacco, Dash Shaw, Sabrina Jones, Chris Ware, Jillian Tamaki, Jaime Hernandez, Jeff Smith, Paul Pope, Kevin Huizenga, and others</p></div><!-- End description for The Best American Comics 2011 --><span class="asin">0547333625</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumE4FE42C8-7EDA-4ACC-8CE5-3276DC6FAA67"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('E4FE42C8-7EDA-4ACC-8CE5-3276DC6FAA67');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E4FE42C8-7EDA-4ACC-8CE5-3276DC6FAA67-256.png" width="170" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0618871713?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Alison%20Bechdel&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Alison Bechdel  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>A fresh and brilliantly told memoir from a cult favorite comic artist, marked by gothic twists, a family funeral home, sexual angst, and great books.<br><br>This breakout book by Alison Bechdel is a darkly funny family tale, pitch-perfectly illustrated with Bechdel's sweetly gothic drawings. Like Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, it's a story exhilaratingly suited to graphic memoir form.<br><br>Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned "fun home," as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescense, the denouement is swift, graphic — and redemptive.</p></div><!-- End description for Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic --><span class="asin">0618871713</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium98A365E2-CE3F-4BBC-B862-234E43CE2880"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('98A365E2-CE3F-4BBC-B862-234E43CE2880');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/98A365E2-CE3F-4BBC-B862-234E43CE2880-256.png" width="178" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525951342?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Gordon%20Bell%0AJim%20Gemmell&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Gordon Bell, Jim Gemmell  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>THE TOTAL RECALL REVOLUTION IS INEVITABLE.<br><br>IT WILL CHANGE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.<br><br>IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.<br><br>What if you could remember everything? Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell draw on their experience from their MyLifeBits project at Microsoft Research to explain the benefits to come from an earth-shaking and inevitable increase in electronic memories. In 1998 they began using Bell, a luminary in the computer world, as a test case, attempting to digitally record as much of his life as possible. Photos, letters, and memorabilia were scanned. Everything he did on his computer was captured. He wore an automatic camera, an arm-strap that logged his bio-metrics, and began recording telephone calls. This experiment, and the system they created to support it, put them at the center of a movement studying the creation and enjoyment of e-memories.<br><br>Since then the three streams of technology feeding the Total Recall revolution—digital recording, digital storage, and digital search, have become gushing torrents. We are capturing so much of our lives now, be it on the date- and location-stamped photos we take with our smart phones or in the continuous records we have of our emails, instant messages, and tweets—not to mention the GPS tracking of our movements many cars and smart phones already do automatically. We are storing what we capture either out there in the “cloud” of services such as Facebook or on our very own increasingly massive and cheap hard drives. But the critical technology, and perhaps least understood, is our magical new ability to find the information we want in the mountain of data that is our past. And not just Google it, but data mine it so that, say, we can chart how much exercise we have been doing in the last four weeks in comparison with what we did four years ago. In health, education, work life, and our personal lives, the Total Recall revolution is going to change everything. As Bell and Gemmell show, it has already begun.<br><br>Total Recall provides a glimpse of the near future. Imagine heart monitors woven into your clothes and tiny wearable audio and visual recorders automatically capturing what you see and hear. Imagine being able to summon up the e-memories of your great grandfather and his avatar giving you advice about whether or not to go to college, accept that job offer, or get married. The range of potential insights is truly awesome. But Bell and Gemmell also show how you can begin to take better advantage of this new technology right now. From how to navigate the serious question of privacy and serious problem of application compatibility to what kind of startups Bell is willing to invest in and which scanner he prefers, this is a book about a turning point in human knowledge as well as an immediate practical guide.<br><br>Total Recall is a technological revolution that will accomplish nothing less than a transformation in the way humans think about the meaning of their lives.<br><br>Watch a Video</p></div><!-- End description for Total Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything --><span class="asin">0525951342</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="index.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="index.html">1</a> <span class="page">2</span> <a class="page" href="livres-3.html">3</a> <a class="page" href="livres-4.html">4</a> <a class="page" href="livres-5.html">5</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="livres-3.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
