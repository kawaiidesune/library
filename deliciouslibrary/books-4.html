He is full of life, and devoted to Covenant. But Covenant is strangely changed. Sarcastic and bragging, he no longer seems like the man whom Linden adored. And yet he says he has a plan: he will take her and Jeremiah to a place where they can find a pure source of Earthpower and, after he has achieved his own purposes, Linden will be free to use that great power to go home, to take Jeremiah home, or to do anything else she sees fit. Even though she distrusts the seemingly different man he has now become, how can she make any choice except to follow him?<br><br>Their journey will cover unimaginable distances through the Land-even through time itself-and will test Linden's courage again and again. In the end, fulfilling her destiny will call for a terrible leap of faith: Can she give up everything she thought had been restored to her, for the sake of the Land?</p></div><!-- End description for Fatal Revenant --><span class="asin">0399154469</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/7ECA6ED3-3BA3-49F4-B6A3-66E7DB8EACF4-256.png" width="170" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060621796?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Living Judaism: The Complete Guide to Jewish Belief, Tradition, and Practice</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Wayne%20D.%20Dosick&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Wayne D.

In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid.

Contents include Micromégas (Voltaire), La Messe de l'Athée (Honoré de Balzac), La Légende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier (Gustave Flaubert), Le Spleen de Paris (Charles Baudelaire), Menuet (Guy de Maupassant), Mort de Judas (Paul Claudel), Le Retour de l'Enfant Prodigue (André Gide), Grand-Lebrun (François Mauriac), Le Passe-Muraille (Marcel Aymé), and L'Hôte (Albert Camus). Students of French, or those who wish to refresh their knowledge of the language, will welcome this treasury of masterly fiction. The selections are arranged chronologically, allowing the reader to witness the development of French literary art — from Voltaire to Camus.

To Stalin, he was such a threat that he warranted murder by pickax. This polarizing figure set up a world conflict that lasted through the twentieth century, and in Trotsky: A Graphic Biography, the renowned comic artist Rick Geary uses his distinct style to depict the stark reality of the man and his times. Trotsky's life becomes a guide to the creation of the Soviet Union, the horrors of World War I, and the establishment of international communism as he, Lenin, and their fellow Bolsheviks rise from persecution and a life underground to the height of political power. Ranging from his boyhood in the Ukraine to his fallout with Stalin and his moonlight romance with Frida Kahlo, Trotsky is a stunning look at one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers and the far-reaching political trends that he launched.</p></div><!-- End description for Trotsky: A Graphic Biography --><span class="asin">0809095084</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/788777EC-67CD-486D-8ED6-D53F436DE920-256.png" width="181" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0931779618?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Jefferson Bible for the Twenty-first Century</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Luis%20Granados%0ARoy%20Speckhardt&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Luis Granados, Roy Speckhardt  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Paperback: 194 pages Publisher: Humanist Press;

what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick.  Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.<br> <br>In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold.  Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives.  And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.  This remarkable book will start you on your way.</p></div><!-- End description for The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future --><span class="asin">0307951529</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/87B725B3-DBB4-4509-B979-8B1D09F8CC2C-256.png" width="188" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399536108?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Chris%20Guillebeau&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Chris Guillebeau  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>If you've ever thought, "There must be more to life than this," The Art of Non-Conformity is for you.<br><br>Based on Chris Guillebeau's popular online manifesto "A Brief Guide to World Domination," The Art of Non-Conformity defies common assumptions about life and work while arming you with the tools to live differently.
