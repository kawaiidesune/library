From remotely controlling the overhead paging system of a large supermarket, to confusing the phone company with various call forwarding stunts, this bizarre collection of pranks will not only make you laugh, but will make you question the security and sanity of common, everyday business procedures. Learn how one illustrious member of the PLA crossed the country on stolen credit cards, staying in the nicest hotels one day and then sleeping on the streets of major cities the next, all while amusing himself at the expense of others. Laugh as he turns a radio morning show into his own interactive game, enrages users of an online auction site, uses revenge tactics that cross the line, systematically drives convenience store employees nuts so that he can get a job, and confuses an entire neighborhood of cordless phone users. The stories contained in this book are based on the writings from the Phone Losers of America website which have been featured in USA Today, the Boston Herald, 2600, on CNBC, CNN, TechTV, and countless other websites, books, magazines, radio shows and police reports.</p></div><!-- End description for Phone Losers of America --><span class="asin">1452876169</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumB7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/B7C27A1D-8E94-4951-844F-E3C5D8B6FFF7-256.png" width="184" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/078582944X?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Nigel%20Cawthorne&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Nigel Cawthorne  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Despite being incredibly popular during his time, Nikola Tesla today remains largely overlooked among lists of the greatest inventors and scientists of the modern era. Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<br><br>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<br><br>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.</p></div><!-- End description for Tesla: The Life and Times of an Electric Messiah --><span class="asin">078582944X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/63AA31C7-56BB-4C44-97AC-AD39CF06A85C-256.png" width="177" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0975914723?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Raymond%20Chandler&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Raymond Chandler  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Book on Michael Jackson All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up</p></div><!-- End description for All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up --><span class="asin">0975914723</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium06BD89EE-2DD8-4DCF-85F1-E4CEB6229A0D"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('06BD89EE-2DD8-4DCF-85F1-E4CEB6229A0D');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/06BD89EE-2DD8-4DCF-85F1-E4CEB6229A0D-256.png" width="171" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1623150310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Paleo for Beginners: Essentials to Get Started</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=John%20Chatham&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">John Chatham  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Discover why more people continue to choose Paleo for Beginners—the New York Times bestselling Paleo cookbook that has sold over 150,000 copies sold—more than any other Paleo cookbook.<br><br>Paleo is not just another fad diet; it is the diet humans were designed to eat.

You can practically see the stomach rippling sinuously, the hips shimmying wildly, and the hair whipping around as the dancer twirls.</p></div><!-- End description for Belly Dancing Basics --><span class="asin">140271078X</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumCE645BC0-1A8A-4269-A110-7E13E00E8AE0"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('CE645BC0-1A8A-4269-A110-7E13E00E8AE0');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/CE645BC0-1A8A-4269-A110-7E13E00E8AE0-256.png" width="213" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356956?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Deploying Rails: Automate, Deploy, Scale, Maintain, and Sleep at Night</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Tom%20Copeland%0AAnthony%20Burns&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Tom Copeland, Anthony Burns  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Today's modern Rails applications have lots of moving parts. Make sure your next production deployment goes smoothly with this hands-on book, which guides you through the entire production process. You'll set up scripts to install and configure all the software your servers need, including your application code. Once you're in production, you'll learn how to set up systems to monitor your application's health, gather metrics so you can stop problems before they start, and fix things when they go wrong.<br><br>Deploying Rails takes you on a expertly guided tour of the current best practices in Rails deployment and management. You'll find in-depth explanations on effectively running a Rails app by leveraging popular open source tools such as Puppet, Capistrano, and Vagrant. Then you'll go beyond deployment and learn how to use Ganglia and Nagios to monitor your application's health and gather metrics so you can head off problems before they happen.<br><br>You'll start out by building your own virtual environment by writing scripts to provision a production server with Vagrant and Puppet. Then you'll leverage the popular Rails deployment tool Capistrano to deploy an application into this infrastructure. Once the app is live, you'll monitor your application's health with Nagios, and configure Ganglia to collect system metrics. Finally, you'll see how to keep your data backed up, recover data when things go wrong, tame your log files, and use Puppet to automate everything along the way.<br><br>Whether you're a Rails developer who wants a better understanding of the needs of a production Rails system, if you're a system administrator who wants to manage a Rails application, or if you're bridging the gap between development and operations, this book will be your roadmap to successful production deployment and maintenance, whether your application has ten users or ten million users.<br><br>What You Need:<br><br>The exercises and examples are most suited to a computer running some Unix variant, such as Mac OS X or Linux. But a Windows machine running Linux in a VirtualBox virtual machine is also sufficient.<br><br>We'll show you how to set up a local virtual machine for your deployments; you won't need a dedicated server to hone your deployment skills. We expect you to have a basic familiarity with the Ruby programming language, the Ruby on Rails framework, and the Unix command line.</p></div><!-- End description for Deploying Rails: Automate, Deploy, Scale, Maintain, and Sleep at Night --><span class="asin">1934356956</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium30671497-0435-4D84-A907-185121DB5418"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('30671497-0435-4D84-A907-185121DB5418');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/30671497-0435-4D84-A907-185121DB5418-256.png" width="194" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1440328307?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Mastering Manga 2: Level Up with Mark Crilley</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Mark%20Crilley&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Mark Crilley  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Level UP and master more manga with YouTube's most popular art instructor, Mark Crilley!<br><br>It's here!<br><br>The highly anticipated follow-up to the best-selling Mastering Manga provides everything you need, regardless of your skill-level, to learn how to draw manga like a pro.<br><br>Graphic novelist and YouTube's most popular art instructor Mark Crilley is back to lead you on your artistic journey.
