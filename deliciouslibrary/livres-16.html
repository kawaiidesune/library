Great companies are made, not born. The secret is hiring the right people—the "A" players. This is, of course, easier said than done. Statistically, half of all employment situations result in a mis-hire; the wrong person for the wrong job. And with the cost of a mis-hire at twenty-four times salary, the financial drain can be staggering! Compare that with Brad Smart's 90% success rate and understand why topgraded organizations such as General Electric and Allied Signal consistently beat the competition. In this unparalleled work, Dr. Smart introduces readers to the tograding concept—how and why it works. The author sets forth principles which hold true for Fortune 500 companies as well as small emerging companies. Topgrading is a silver bullet—the corporate initiative that empowers all other corporate initiatives. The author spells out his practical hands-on approach and provides intriguing case studies culled from his file of more than 4,000 in-depth interviews. Topgrading's expert coaching techniques are also revealed and readers learn how managers who topgrade become leaders, achieving success and excellence not only for their companies, but also for themselves. This book is not without controversy, however, as Brad discusses how those who don't pull their own weight, the chronic "C" players, must step aside, be redeployed, or terminated.</p></div><!-- End description for Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching and Keeping the Best People --><span class="asin">0735200491</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumFF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('FF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/FF83D88D-72B7-4317-BFCB-8B573FBF74B3-256.png" width="166" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610693132?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=David%20E.%20Newton%20Ph.D.&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">David E.

To deliver key players that are both realistic and compelling, writers must know them intimately—not only who they are in the present story, but also what made them that way. Of all the formative experiences in a character’s past, none are more destructive than emotional wounds. The aftershocks of trauma can change who they are, alter what they believe, and sabotage their ability to achieve meaningful goals, all of which will affect the trajectory of your story. Identifying the backstory wound is crucial to understanding how it will shape your character’s behavior, and The Emotional Wound Thesaurus can help. Inside, you’ll find: • A database of traumatic situations common to the human experience • An in-depth study on a wound’s impact, including the fears, lies, personality shifts, and dysfunctional behaviors that can arise from different painful events • An extensive analysis of character arc and how the wound and any resulting unmet needs fit into it • Techniques on how to show the past experience to readers in a way that is both engaging and revelatory while avoiding the pitfalls of info dumps and telling • A showcase of popular characters and how their traumatic experiences reshaped them, leading to very specific story goals • A Backstory Wound Profile tool that will enable you to document your characters’ negative past experiences and the aftereffects Root your characters in reality by giving them an authentic wound that causes difficulties and prompts them to strive for inner growth to overcome it. With its easy-to-read format and over 100 entries packed with information, The Emotional Wound Thesaurus is a crash course in psychology for creating characters that feel incredibly real to readers.</p></div><!-- End description for The Emotional Wound Thesaurus: A Writer&apos;s Guide to Psychological Trauma --><span class="asin">0989772594</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium027FB854-579E-4212-8E10-7B86B99A294B"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('027FB854-579E-4212-8E10-7B86B99A294B');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/027FB854-579E-4212-8E10-7B86B99A294B-256.png" width="171" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610398084?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Zoe%20Quinn&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Zoe Quinn  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>You've heard the stories about the dark side of the internet—hackers, #gamergate, anonymous mobs attacking an unlucky victim, and revenge porn—but they remain just that: stories. Surely these things would never happen to you.<br><br>Zoe Quinn used to feel the same way. She is a video game developer whose ex-boyfriend published a crazed blog post cobbled together from private information, half-truths, and outright fictions, along with a rallying cry to the online hordes to go after her. They answered in the form of a so-called movement known as #gamergate—they hacked her accounts; stole nude photos of her; harassed her family, friends, and colleagues; and threatened to rape and murder her. But instead of shrinking into silence as the online mobs wanted her to, she raised her voice and spoke out against this vicious online culture and for making the internet a safer place for everyone.<br><br>In the years since #gamergate, Quinn has helped thousands of people with her advocacy and online-abuse crisis resource Crash Override Network. From locking down victims' personal accounts to working with tech companies and lawmakers to inform policy, she has firsthand knowledge about every angle of online abuse, what powerful institutions are (and aren't) doing about it, and how we can protect our digital spaces and selves.<br><br>Crash Override offers an up-close look inside the controversy, threats, and social and cultural battles that started in the far corners of the internet and have since permeated our online lives. Through her story—as target and as activist—Quinn provides a human look at the ways the internet impacts our lives and culture, along with practical advice for keeping yourself and others safe online.</p></div><!-- End description for Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate --><span class="asin">1610398084</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="livres-15.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="livres-14.html">14</a> <a class="page" href="livres-15.html">15</a> <span class="page">16</span> <a class="page" href="livres-17.html">17</a> <a class="page" href="livres-18.html">18</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="livres-17.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
