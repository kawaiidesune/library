In this entirely new kind of photography guide, written by Mr. Lange and Scott Mowbray, magazine editor and longtime amateur photographer, the rest of us will learn how to take photographs that don’t just document life but celebrate it.<br><br>No fancy equipment required. Just hundreds of simple, inspiring ideas and lessons―each one illustrated with a photograph―organized around the six essential principles of seeing like a photographer. (Here’s one: Shoot the Moment, Not the Subject.)<br><br>Here’s why to shoot in natural light―always. The fun of putting babies in surprising places. How to get intimate with food. Using a dramatic sky as your backdrop. The benefit of learning to know the light in every room of your house. Shooting hands or feet instead of faces. How to move past the “I was here” postcard effect. How to catch the in-between moments. Because in the end, it’s about living the moment, shooting the moment―and being in the moment forever.</p></div><!-- End description for The Unforgettable Photograph: 228 Ideas, Tips, and Secrets for Taking the Best Pictures of Your Life --><span class="asin">0761169237</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumBC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('BC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/BC1EA0AE-8203-479A-A190-F9EDBC85D4C4-256.png" width="256" height="253"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0770434037?SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Beautiful Mess Photo Idea Book: 95 Inspiring Ideas for Photographing Your Friends, Your World, and Yourself</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Elsie%20Larson%0AEmma%20Chapman&amp;SubscriptionId=1XKMQ76GH235KSFB1M02&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Elsie Larson, Emma Chapman  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Ready to show your photos some love?<br> <br>Whether it’s of your sister’s smile, your morning coffee, or your new puppy, photos are a way to connect on Facebook and Instagram, keep a visual diary of our lives, and create momentos for future generations.
