The first English edition of these rules was available in Francis Hawkins' Youths Behavior, or Decency in Conversation Amongst Men, which appeared in 1640, and it is from work that Washington seems to have copied. The rules as Washington wrote them out are a simplified version of this text. However much he may have simplified them, these precepts had a strong influence on Washington, who aimed to always live by them. The rules focus on self-respect and respect for others through details of etiquette. The rules offer pointers on such issues as how to dress, walk, eat in public, and address one's superiors.</p></div><!-- End description for George Washington&apos;s Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation --><span class="asin">155709103X</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium57181EB9-6615-489F-9F9D-B5824A4A5D2E"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('57181EB9-6615-489F-9F9D-B5824A4A5D2E');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/57181EB9-6615-489F-9F9D-B5824A4A5D2E-256.png" width="143" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0978924622?SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Outlining Your Novel: Map Your Way to Success</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=K.%20M.%20Weiland&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRNVAMRG7KO5ILWQ&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">K.
